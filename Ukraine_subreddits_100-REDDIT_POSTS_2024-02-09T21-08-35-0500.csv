[Click on this link and then type your zip code](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member). It's a simple process that will show you your representatives of both the House and your two senators. Their party affiliation, tenure in congress, and Washington DC phone number will all be displayed.

&#x200B;

**How They Voted:**

[This is a link to Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/). Once you click on it you will see a search bar towards the top of the page. Here is where you can type any of the previously mentioned bills (i.e. HR5692). The results page will show you the top result: HR5692 -- Ukraine Security Assistance and Oversight Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024. **From there look for ""role call vote"" and click on the link for ""1 role call vote"". Then click on ""Role no. 503"".** The next pages shows every representative's vote; additionally, you can filter the result by 'Yay', 'Nay', by state, by party, and also searching your representative's name. It's a relatively simple process, and very easy to do once you know what to look for and where to click.

&#x200B;

**What To Say When You Call:**

Using the same example as above, HR5692, I called the representative from my hometown and said something like this: 

\>Hello, my name is John Doe, and I am calling from MyHometown. I strongly support Ukraine and their war against Ruzzia is a very important matter to me. I see Representative Person'sName voted against bill HR5692 on September 28, 2023, and was wondering if he is planning on supporting Ukraine in the future.

Representative Person'sName's aid says something something blah blah something. *I now know my hometown's representative voted NO on that bill, as well as several others regarding Ukraine, so my responses was as follows:*

\>Given Representative Person'sName's voting history against bills that would support Ukraine I will have you know that I will never again support Representative Person'sName, and will be voting against them in every election from now on because they do not represent my interests.

Use that script if you would like, or improvise and make your own. The point is to let them know you WILL NOT vote for them because they do not represent your voice and your interests. The same can be done when you call your senators. 

The assistants take notes, so it is important to call often. Remember, **WE** vote for **THEM** to represent **US** and **OUR** interests. And if they are not representing our interests then they need to go, now more than ever.

&#x200B;

**Lastly, This Is One More Way You Can Support Ukraine:**

Here is a link to [United24](https://u24.gov.ua/). Donations to this initiative of President Zelenskyy go directly to the bank of Ukraine, to provide relief in the forms of Defense, Medical Aid, Science and Education, Humanitarian Demining, and Rebuilding Ukraine. Every donation, large and small, makes a tremendous difference. 

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr: The least we can do from afar is calling our local elected officials regarding their voting history and plans to support or abandon Ukraine, and that we will vote for or against them, and by donating to Ukraine's victory. Above I have explained how to do so as quickly and simply as possible.

ukraine,1alxi6a,"""A Russian Victory in Ukraine Would Imperil Us All."" - says Olaf Scholz in Wall Street Journal commentary. ""The West must sustain support for Kyiv, keep NATO solid, and spurn Putin’s effort to divide us.""","[https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-russian-victory-in-ukraine-would-imperil-us-all-abee35e6](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-russian-victory-in-ukraine-would-imperil-us-all-abee35e6)

**Olaf Scholz:**

Make no mistake: A Russian victory in Ukraine would not only be the end of Ukraine as a free, democratic and independent state, it would also dramatically change the face of Europe. It would deal a severe blow to the liberal world order. Russia’s brutal attempt to steal territory by force could serve as a blueprint for other authoritarian leaders around the globe. More countries would run the risk of falling prey to a nearby predator.

This possibility is why the U.S. and Europe support Ukraine’s fight for freedom. President Biden’s leadership has been critical to ensure that [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin)’s aggression is met with a united and successful response. So far, Mr. Putin hasn’t achieved any of his war goals. He thought that he could take the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, within two weeks. After two years, he still is far from accomplishing this, and Ukraine is bravely withstanding the Russian onslaught. This is due to the heroic fighting of the Ukrainian people, but it’s also a result of the West’s fiscal and humanitarian support and the delivery of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine.

The European Union and its member states have been Ukraine’s largest financial supporter, having contributed more than $91 billion since the beginning of the war, followed by the U.S. and Germany. Germany’s military support is second only to America’s. Since the war began, my government has earmarked, procured and delivered military equipment, including tanks, artillery and high-value air-defense systems, worth more than $30 billion. This has come on top of Germany’s nonmilitary support, including welcoming over one million Ukrainian refugees, and our share of the EU’s support.

Our message is clear: We have to do our utmost to prevent Russia from winning. If we don’t, we might soon wake up in a world even more unstable, threatening and unpredictable than it was during the Cold War. Despite our support, Ukraine could soon face serious shortages in arms and ammunition. Some financial commitments have already run out, and others need to be extended. The long-term consequences and costs of failing to stop Mr. Putin’s aggression would dwarf any of the investments that we are making now.

Hello! My name is \[your name\] and I live in \[city, state\]. My zip code is \[zip code\]. 

I’m calling to urge \[Representative’s Name\] to pass H.R. 815 or a standalone supplemental that includes Ukraine aid.

I am appalled that for four months now we have neglected to pass additional funding for Ukraine. Helping Ukraine defeat Russia is in the interests of America, and we should finally act like it and stop playing politics with this issue.

Ukraine is destroying Russia’s forces for less than 5% of our annual defense budget, and if we abandon Ukraine now it will send a clear message to China and other adversaries that America is too weak to help its friends, and too divided to stand up for its own interests.

This issue will affect my vote next election.

An Israel-only Supplemental will be dead on arrival in the Senate.

This is made additionally clear by the language used in his announcement (link above).

ActionForUkraine,19cix38,US: Upcoming battle over Ukraine aid Supplemental,"The Senate will likely present its version of the Ukraine aid/border supplemental in the near future. It is incredibly important that as soon as this happens, we call on our American friends and followers on social media to reach out to their Senators and encourage them to vote yes.

Contacting representatives is highly effective: aides of representatives record the number of people who voice support for an issue, which in turn impacts the stance the representative takes. Moreover, whereas before only Republicans were the target, now we need to convince Democrats opposed to immigration reform that it is worthwhile in exchange for supporting Ukraine. Furthermore, the margin by which it passes plays a role; if the Supplemental passes 90-10, Johnson will be under tremendous pressure to bring it for a vote in the House. If it passes 60-40, he can ignore it.

I will post again once the Senate presents the Ukraine aid/border supplemental.

&#x200B;

**Sample post for social media for later use (once Supplemental is presented):**

Three months have passed since further aid to Ukraine has stalled in US Congress. As of 2024, no further military aid is being provided by the US to Ukraine. In light of this I'd like to summarize three key arguments for continuing to support Ukraine:

1. Ukraine is in a fight for its freedom, independence and existence. Ukraine has already liberated over 50% of the territory captured by Russia since the start of the war. There is no support within Ukraine for a ceasefire with Russia; doing so would condemn Ukrainians on occupied territory to rape, torture and deportation, while rewarding tyrants around the world and signaling that Western resolve is weak. We intend to keep fighting.
2. US aid overwhelmingly consists of weapons from American stocks. [Almost 90%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/29/ukraine-military-aid-american-economy-boost/) of the funds allocated for supporting Ukraine are then spent with US manufacturers for replenishing American stocks. The total of this amount is approximately 5% of America's annual defense budget. Without additional funding from Congress to replenish American stocks for weapons sent to Ukraine, there will be no more military aid to Ukraine.
3. Europe has provided [more aid to Ukraine than the US](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/ukraine-support-tracker-europe-clearly-overtakes-us-with-total-commitments-now-twice-as-large/). The narrative that Europe is not doing enough is false. However, Europe alone does not have sufficient weaponry, while Russia has placed a huge portion of its economy on war-footing and is being supplied with weapons by China, Iran and North Korea.

This week the Senate finally presented a bill to fund military aid to Ukraine. Please take a couple minutes to call on your representatives to support it: [https://www.votervoice.net/RAZOMFORUKRAINE/Campaigns/107413/Respond?vvsn=BEOy4A5KBCVOaA0uZAd7FAA](https://www.votervoice.net/RAZOMFORUKRAINE/Campaigns/107413/Respond?vvsn=BEOy4A5KBCVOaA0uZAd7FAA)

Dear Sir/Madam \[ENTER NAME HERE\],

Following Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, I was proud to see Australia join a coalition of like-minded nations in supporting Ukraine’s fight for freedom with arms such as the Australian Bushmaster.

On December 17, 2023, Ukraine’s Chief of Intelligence Budanov sent a letter to Richard Marles asking that 45 Taipan MRH-90 that we have been planning to scrap instead be sent to Ukraine. As such it is tremendously disappointing and embarrassing to hear that on January 18, 2024, our government refused to send 45 Taipan MRH-90 to Ukraine, preferring instead to dismantle and bury them. As has been pointed out in multiple publications such as: [https://asiapacificdefencereporter.com/no-minister-taipan-helicopters-are-extremely-safe/](https://asiapacificdefencereporter.com/no-minister-taipan-helicopters-are-extremely-safe/) \- the Taipan helicopters are safe. Moreover, considering Ukraine is fighting for its survival and has asked for the helicopters, even if helicopters are deemed unsafe for our use, Ukraine clearly prefers having them. It is simply inconceivable that we instead prefer to trash the $900 million worth of Taipans.

Australia has at this point fallen behind other Western allies in arms supplies to Ukraine. As a proportion of GDP, we are now behind Malta. As a voter from your division I ask that you look into this matter, and would greatly appreciate a response.

Yours Sincerely,

\[YOUR NAME\]

**Long text:**

Friends,

Many of us participate in gathering funds for drones and vehicles for AUF, but there is another battle that Ukrainians and our allies abroad have been neglecting. 

Although we exert influence internationally through media campaigns, the most effective way of **influencing government in democracies is through direct contact with elected officials**.

Why does this work?

A politician/party seeks to be reelected. When a voter contacts his/her own representative in parliament, aides record what the voter requested. A **voter can make it clear that his/her vote in upcoming elections depends on the politician's stance on Ukraine**, and ask to receive a response outlining the politician's position.

Друзі,

Багато хто з нас бере участь у зборі коштів на безпілотники та транспорт для ЗСУ, але є ще одна важлива битва, якій українці та наші союзники за кордоном не приділяють достатньої уваги.

Хоча ми вже здійснюємо глобальний вплив за допомогою кампаній у ЗМІ, найефективнішим способом впливу на уряд у демократичних країнах є прямий **контакт виборців із обраними посадовцями**.

Щоб нагадати їм, що виборці підтримують Україну та очікують конкретних дій, активісти створили [actionforukraine.org](https://actionforukraine.org/): тут перераховано пріоритети та інструкції, як зв’язатися з вашим представником у вашій країні, і все це за <1 хв.

Чому це працює?

Політик/партія прагне бути переобраним. Коли виборець зв’язується зі своїм представником в парламенті, помічники записують, що виборець просив. **Виборець може дати зрозуміти, що його голос на майбутніх виборах залежить від позиції політика щодо України**, і навіть попросити, щоб офіс політика зв’язався з ним.  [Actionforukraine.org](https://actionforukraine.org/) допомагає зробити саме це менш ніж за 1 хвилину. Це один з найефективніших методів, якими користуються лобістські організації у Франції, Німеччині, а особливо — у США.",abitStoic,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActionForUkraine/comments/1915wl7/friends_without_reddit_share_the_site/,/r/ActionForUkraine/comments/1915wl7/friends_without_reddit_share_the_site/,1,2024-01-07 23:21:05,36,,False,0.97,None,2024-02-09 21:07:59.325012

Hej Ulf Kristersson,

Jag har nyligen lagt märke till att Sverige och Ukraina har haft bilaterala möte om att överlämna Jas Gripen stridsflygplan till Ukraina och utbilda ukrainska piloter. Det är en utmärkt insats och jag hoppas på att Sverige gör sin yttersta för att göra det möjligt.

Ukraina har varit Europas sköld, mot ett aggressivt Ryssland som ämnar att förstöra västvärlden och NATO. Som ett land som står vid NATOs sida och är i ansökningsprocessen för att ansluta sig till alliansen samt har stridit mot Ryssland i det förflutna bör vi göra allt vi kan för att stötta Ukraina och en ukrainsk seger. Att hjälpa Ukraina idag är smartare och billigare än att slås mot kaoset som skulle komma till Europa om Ryssland besegrar Ukraina.

Som svensk medborgare ser jag gärna att du gör allt i din makt för att försätta ukrainska stridspiloters träning och provflygning av Jas Gripen och förbreda överlämningen av flygplan till Ukraina.

Med vänliga hälsningar,
[Ditt namn och adress]

Monsieur le Premier ministre,

Alors  que l’invasion illégale de l’Ukraine par la Russie entre dans sa troisième année, il est clair qu’il faut faire davantage pour soutenir  l’Ukraine et punir la Russie.

De nombreux pays prennent aujourd’hui des mesures concrètes pour adopter  une législation qui permettra de débloquer les fonds russes gelés pour  aider les Ukrainiens. Aux États-Unis, il y a « REPO act » (The  Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act : [https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4175/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4175/text)),  qui a déjà passé le stade de la commission à la Chambre des  représentants. Un projet de loi parallèle est en cours d’examen au  Sénat. Au Canada, la deuxième lecture du projet de Loi S-278 ([https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/fr/44-1/projet-loi/S-278/premiere-lecture](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/fr/44-1/projet-loi/S-278/premiere-lecture))  est en cours. En Europe, l’Estonie devrait être la première à adopter  une loi autorisant l’envoi de fonds russes gelés pour aider les  Ukrainiens. Le 27 octobre 2023, Ursula von der Leyen a déclaré que la  Commission européenne travaillait également à l’utilisation des  bénéfices tirés des actifs gelés de l’État russe pour aider l’Ukraine.

La Belgique a gelé 180 milliards d’euros d’actifs russes, soit plus que tout autre pays. Cet argent a déjà généré plus de 3 milliards d’euros des intérêts cette année. Il est logique, d’un point de vue pratique et moral, que nous nous joignions à nos alliés pour trouver un moyen d’utiliser cet argent pour aider les Ukrainiens. La prospérité et la victoire de l’Ukraine rendraient l’Europe plus sûre, et la confiscation des avoirs des tyrans engagés dans la guerre et le génocide créerait un précédent important pour le monde.

Binnen enkele maanden treedt de illegale invasie van Rusland in Oekraïne zijn derde jaar in. Nu meer dan ooit is het duidelijk dat Oekraïne nog meer steun nodig heeft en dat er bijkomende sancties tegen Rusland dienen genomen te worden.

Zoals u wellicht weet zijn er in de loop van de voorbije twee jaar Russische tegoeden bevroren door meerdere landen in zowel de EU als Noord-Amerika. Meerdere van deze landen zijn nu concrete stappen aan het nemen om wetgeving in te voeren die hen in staat stelt om deze in beslag te nemen en nadien te overhandigen aan Oekraïne, dit met het oog op wederopbouw van het land.

In de Verenigde Staten is er de REPO Act (The Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act) welke al goedkeuring heeft gekregen in het Congres. Parallel hieraan ligt er ook een Act op tafel in de Senaat. In Canada ligt een soortgelijke Bill op tafel (Bill S-278). Na een eerste doorlichting hiervan wordt deze nu voor de tweede maal doorgenomen indien er aanpassing of details moeten worden bijgevoegd.

Naar verwachting zal Estland het eerste land binnen de EU zijn die een wet doorvoert die hen in staat stelt om bevroren Russische tegoeden in beslag te nemen en nadien te gebruiken om Oekraïne te helpen. Ursula von der Leyen deelde op 27 oktober 2023 dat ook de Europese Commissie alles in het werk aan het stellen was om ook de tegoeden die zij hebben bevroren van Rusland over te kunnen dragen naar Oekraïne voor de wederopbouw.

Dat brengt ons bij België. 180 miljard aan Russische tegoeden staan bij ons bevroren. Op deze tegoeden zijn 2.3 miljard belastingen verdiend welke al zijn toegewezen aan Oekraïne naast de F-16s in 2025. Maar we kunnen meer doen. Het is moreel en praktisch verantwoord dat we samen met onze partners in de EU en NAVO een legale manier vinden om ook die 180 miljard aan Oekraïne over te kunnen dragen. Niet alleen zou het land zichzelf weer kunnen opbouwen na de oorlog maar het zou ook een precedent en boodschap sturen naar alle dictators en tirannen die van deze onstabiele tijden gebruik willen maken om zichzelf te verrijken.

Mijn stem voor uw partij zal afhangen van uw standpunt jegens Oekraïne  en een antwoord op deze vraag zou enorm geapprecieerd worden.

Dear Sir/Madam \[ENTER NAME HERE\],

Following Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, I was proud to see Australia join the US, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, Japan and others in freezing roughly $300 billion in Russian central bank assets. Unfortunately, as the invasion nears its second year, it is clear that more needs to be done both to support Ukraine and punish Russia.

Many countries are now taking concrete steps towards passing legislation that will allow the disbursement of frozen Russian funds to aid Ukrainians. In the US, there is the REPO act, which does just that and has already passed the committee stage in the US House. A parallel bill is making its way through the Senate. In Canada, the second reading of S-278 is in progress. In Europe, Estonia is set to be the first to pass a law to allow frozen Russian funds to be sent to aid Ukrainians. On October 27, 2023, Ursula von der Leyen stated that the European Commission is also working on using the profits derived from frozen Russian state assets to help Ukraine.

Australia has been a friend to Ukraine in its hour of greatest need. We should join our allies around the world in passing legislation that would repurpose Russian assets frozen in Australia. As a voter from your division I ask that you look into this matter, and would greatly appreciate a response.

In June of 2023 an amendment was made to Legislation No. 665 to use sanctions for the express purpose of promoting Russia compensating Ukraine for the destruction caused. Although this was a welcome addition it remains woefully inadequate and unspecific.

Monsters too host their own Oscars.  
Whisper quiet snakes of brimstone  
And the demons are no longer.

Ready printed propaganda,  
Eager lifted pen of Seymour.  
There's no need to quote Miranda:  
They are proud of what they're here for.

Vampire dies in sun, without blood -  
Strange, it's always cold in their home.  
Devils pray and pray for red flood  
While the rivers crimson dark foam.

No one sent the invitation,  
Cut the ties decided brother.  
Manners are the weak's invention  
And a man's flesh is best supper.

For the victims looks the hero -  
From their lives he'll liberate them.  
Foreign language speaks the tree rows:  
Holy fire guards the harsh elm.

Blaze and wrath replies to bullets.  
People's land for fiends is hostile.  
To grey ashes cursed orc tourists  
Turns on flash and roaring gospel.

Graceful road smiles in cold anger:  
They are here and they will not be.  
Each small pebble hides a dagger.  
Rustle, hustle - stinks the debris.

If they fight - why does it matter?  
Bigger always smaller conquer.

Why the crust of hers burnt?  
There were tears, there were mirth,  
Mothers children had nursed.  
And now empty stands church,  
Something dark in days lurked.

And the clouds asked the stream:  
Why she froze in her step?  
Mighty, great had their schemes  
But who water will help.  
Heard the vultures the screams.  
Yet, they relished. And swept.

And the clouds asked the son:  
At whose grave he so wept?  
Sad tales steely wind spun,  
Long gone ghosts overslept.  
But she couldn't outrun.  
Robin’s chest with blood flecked.

And the clouds asked the sea:  
Why her face was so red?  
Not enough of the free  
And too much of the dead.  
Bad men didn't agree.  
So, the good ones must end.

And the clouds asked the blind:  
What for tears from no eyes?  
The hand paper had signed,  
Far away laugh the lies.  
Somewhere someone maligned  
Course of fortune revised.

And the clouds asked the stars:  
Where they bury who fell?  
Came in many proud tsars  
And in tow had the hell.  
Blue them followed the gods,  
Tolls the angry wrath bell.

And the clouds asked the night:  
Will they ever be gone?

Green with envy and want.

ArtForUkraine,18mmo31,One Stayed and One Ran,"Once Mordor lit the sun  
But it was flame infernal.  
The orcs their march begun  
With thousand drunken colonels.

The horde of ogres crazed  
Craved blood, and death, and sorrow.  
They brother own will save  
From peace and good tomorrow.

The eastern sun brought night  
Of endless grief and torment.  
The tyrant had the might -  
Unwilling to the war went.

Two men stood at the front:  
The powerful, the jester.  
The big small to confront  
Lunged and to turn it lesser.

One needed not a ride,  
He needed ammunition.  
Courageous hell defied,  
Stopped ill-born inquisition.

The ghoulish armies burned  
And David hurt the giant.  
Brave stood at gates of world  
To savagery defiant.

A monster wanted crown,  
To be the king of killers.  
He turned himself around  
And took his rotten litters.

The great man wasted none  
A precious, cherished second.  
The emperor did run -  
His fearsome castle beckoned.

The tires away did squeal -  
Proud princes fight no battles.  
The ammo's no appeal:  
The ride is all that matters.

Usurper fried like pig  
But despot clung to concrete.  
The small man was the big,  
The greatest - trembling false priest.

One day they'll tell the tales  
Of dark months, of the hopeless,  
Of heroes at the tails  
Of mercenaries soulless.

How they the dream had brought  
To green fields ripped asunder.  
The peace in tears was wrought  
And all the promised wonders.

A man stayed and he fought,  
A boy ran to his bunker.  
There was a man of salt  
And tiny, feeble monger.",Nightshade20XV12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtForUkraine/comments/18mmo31/one_stayed_and_one_ran/,/r/ArtForUkraine/comments/18mmo31/one_stayed_and_one_ran/,2,2023-12-20 05:12:29,7,,False,1.0, Poem 📝,2024-02-09 21:08:01.090204

And dust crumbles shaking, shaking.  
Bodies rot and bones have melted,  
Echoes never are selected.

Recollections stick to no land.  
Lazy history has head, hand.  
Rich man feels not for the tortured,  
Safe man pities not burnt orchards.

Promises of an eternal  
Memory met by deferrals.  
Each time horror and the outrage,  
Followed steps that fade without trace.

Many times the lies repeated -  
Somehow always undefeated.  
This time gas deal will be better:  
Different, peaceful - a love letter.

Man makes grand claims of endurance,  
Even grander - of remembrance.  
Slips at dawn the morning paper  
And all vows wilt into vapor.

In New York they've fancy floor mop.

Great endless sea beneath blue sky.  
And Viking gods of old did whisper  
The heroes' tales from wisps of rye.

Mom, do you know, when dad will be back  
From travels his, land far away?  
Why are you crying? Come to train tracks!  
He'll come tomorrow or today.

Poor broken land in east was burning -  
The yellow sea did tell us so.  
The men were leaving, few returning.  
For what - I didn't, still don't know.

The calendar was herding hours,  
A tired hand moved torn, hurt lives.  
Then bloomed, then sogged the purple flowers  
And for their rights we paid the price.

White windowsill was cracked and broken.  
Oh, dad, why didn't you come back?  
Mom wept each time of war she's spoken,  
Her gentle face old, sad, and black.

The supple grains each year were raining,  
They're quiet, never said a word.  
New train tracks - they were waiting  
And my words parting falcons heard.

I will return, I will, I promise  
And never ever they'll step here.  
If not, the wheat will tell you honest  
Of me, of dad - don't have no fear.

Google isn't helping, I can only find images that are either too small or are pictures that someone has taken of the stamp itself. I was wondering if someone here might be able to help.

The reason why I'm looking for a black and white image is because I can only really work with two colours since my options are to take skin off the surface of the pumpkin or to leave the skin. Black and white is easiest to work with for pumpkin carving.

The image itself needs to be fairly large since I will be taping a printout of the image to the pumpkin and pricking it with a toothpick. This gives me a series of dots I can connect to make the outline of where I need to remove the pumpkin skin.

On the Moscow's frozen mud.  
Barks at her abused dear vassals  
Princess of the lies and blood.

Dollars swapped for toilet paper,  
Soon a cartwheel will she need.  
On the TV movers, shakers  
Bring the peasants up to speed.

On the three-day noble mission  
That will soon be two whole years.  
On successful brave tradition  
Of good genocide and tears.

On elusive, ghostly Nazis -  
Not the ones that are right here.  
How they're winning war of proxies:  
Sanctions lift, please, lovely, dear.

How they find solutions final,  
How they spread war to all world.  
They'll defeat each stubborn rival -  
Mighty tough men - have you heard.

Wayward brother with his pigeons  
Wanted not to come back home.  
Lust for freedom had, ambitions,  
To be master of his own.

Leaders of the whole big planet,  
Fearsome soldiers right and just.  
In the suitcase was the jacket:  
The parade will be bit rushed.

Plan was never vile and stupid -  
It's a fault of witchcraft, Joe.  
Moscow's men are so well-suited  
Everywhere to run the show.

Someone move those pesky allies  
That are vexing kingly bear.  
They would blow them up to high skies.  
That they can't - it's so unfair.

Western lands are most immoral,  
Eastern waste is honest, pure.  
Murder is the noblest laurel  
Crown that goodness all endures.

Princess wanted to be pretty  
But tiara ran away.  
Thirty looked like double sixty,  
Loathing on the skull decayed.

Prince and princess drank brake liquid,  
Antifreeze, and aftershave.  
Those their foes were so, so wicked:  
None of them feared their own grave.

Fell asleep they in the chamber,  
In a pool of falsehoods own.  
Came to bring the orders neighbour:  
What to say, how curse, how moan.

Cat that's learned still walks the gold chain  
But he tells not where he's from.  
Since the Russian passport's a pain,  
Cat now German has become.",Nightshade20XV12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtForUkraine/comments/17fzk29/the_princess_of_obscenity/,/r/ArtForUkraine/comments/17fzk29/the_princess_of_obscenity/,0,2023-10-25 07:50:06,5,,False,1.0, Poem 📝,2024-02-09 21:08:01.090204

Why, oh, why, oh, why do we keep fighting?  
Here's a lady of milk skin of plenty.  
Mother giving that's for kinship riding.

Canvas blank of small and unimportant.  
Free will never be a prison compound,

chernobyl,1ai9evv,Working at ChNPP,"Hello, dear comrades! I am a simple worker at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, and I have been working at this facility for several years now.

In this post, I will shed light on some aspects of working at the world's most famous nuclear station. I won't be talking about any grand works, great achievements, etc. Truly great and heroic deeds were not covered in the media or on the official website. I will just share some moments that workers at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant encounter. Also, I'll share a few memories of the Russian Federation Armed Forces' presence at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (I happened to experience the ""occupation"" myself).

**Welcome** **~~to hell~~** **at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant!**

I apologize in advance for any inaccuracies in the translation. Originally, everything was written in Russian, so the translation may not be entirely precise

[ Alcohol ](https://preview.redd.it/tf9w8n9xeggc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae70421dae56d570b5421329074ac0afcf8f010)

About alcohol, there will be another post; it's just too relevant.

Shift work and alcohol are inseparable. A person who drinks just can't endure 10 or 13 days without something with alcohol content (I won't pretend to be a saint; I also love to have a drink!).

Until around June-July 2022, military personnel inspected the arriving day or shift workers for alcohol - they checked bags at Semykhody (yes, they decided not to change the arrival point for personnel at the station after the war; well, it used to be by train, now it's in terribly uncomfortable buses, and at Semykhody, you have to change into transitional station clothing). But the bags for most were quite large (clothing, food, various hygiene items like shampoos, shaving foam, etc., and much more). Naturally, hiding a bottle of alcohol at the bottom of the bag was not a big problem; military personnel only superficially inspected the bags of workers, of which there were at least a hundred, with 3-4 military inspectors at Semykhody.

In the winter and autumn-spring seasons, you could easily hide a bottle of alcohol in your jacket; the military did not check the pockets of workers - they didn't conduct those typical inspections where they touched a person from head to toe. They also never checked small bags like clutches. The inspection itself took no more than two minutes.

This is the main reason why they engaged in this until June-July 2023. It yielded no results.

People were already massively smuggling alcohol, usually spirits, which is quite profitable. How much 40-degree drink can you make with a small 0.5-liter bottle of spirits mixed with water? - about 1.3 liters, and if it's a liter of spirits? Accordingly, about 2.6 liters of vodka!

Now there are no inspectors at Semykhody, I'll say right away - I'm glad about that. I openly bring both beer and brandy and wine in quite substantial volumes (my hands and back hurt from the weight, but what can you do - I bring ""divine"" drinks for myself). Until June-July 2022, like everyone else, I preferred to bring spirits, but for me now, having a beer/wine or brandy/purchased vodka is much better - for the taste and to ensure there's no hangover in the morning before work (I know my limit on shift, usually:)). And with spirits - personally, I almost always had a hangover in the morning, even if I drank in the evening and got a ""condition"" not particularly strong, not even average, even 100-150 grams of good wheat spirit diluted with water to 40 degrees makes itself felt in the morning worse than even 200 grams of cheap brandy or 2 liters of beer.

Although now you can bring regular alcohol instead of spirits, many still bring spirits for the same reason - low weight with maximum yield. Some arrange a real alcohol marathon on the shift (both confirmed alcoholics who always drink and those whose wives forbid them to drink at home - these married guys really let loose during the shift). Alcoholics! And there are quite a few of them.

In conclusion: alcohol at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (**at least some joy, I understand that**) pours not like a river but like a damn ocean. On the alcohol grounds at the station, many fights occur, there have been attempts to **murder** colleagues, and I won't comment on flying fire inspectors out of windows, these idiots harass drunk workers over things like kettles, heaters, microwaves, etc. Of course, they, fools, get their faces beaten and sent flying.

About the consumption of alcohol at workplaces, probably a topic for a separate post. Although I'll say right away, most people, if they drink during working hours, do so moderately, fully aware that they are at work and need to be a professional, in case something needs to be done at work, have a clear mind, and normal coordination of movements (you can get hammered after work in the dormitory, which many do).

Well, P.S. after all that has been written - alcohol on the territory of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is strictly prohibited, regardless of whether you are working or relaxing in the dormitory, but that's on paper.

As I said at the beginning of the post: **shift work and alcohol are inseparable**.

Shift workers drank, drink, and will drink, and Chernobyl is no exception; **these are the costs of this work schedule - the shift method**.

By the way: in the cafeteria, you can only buy mineral water, Coca-Cola, and juice (usually tomato) with your own money.

In principle, it's understandable why: Coca-Cola and tomato juice are good for chasing vodka; some mix Coca-Cola with spirits, making drinks with different degrees, but usually up to 20. Mineral water is needed to ""recover"" in the morning after evening gatherings.

&#x200B;

[Food](https://preview.redd.it/hep5k505fggc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68963eb8183a4aced46c810429f0ffd54e0506ea)

The cheaper, the better! 

This phrase perfectly describes the food in the cafeteria. I, of course, don't know how they feed in prison, but it seems to me not much better than in our cafeteria. Barley, wheat, corn porridges are absolutely tasteless and unpleasant (even if you don't eat them on an empty stomach, it's still difficult to handle a couple of spoonfuls of porridge - it's nauseating, in the literal sense of the word, although I'm not a gourmet). Typically, these grains are used to feed chickens and dogs in villages.

Pearl barley is also a frequent guest as a side dish; many don't like it, but I love pearl barley, the one that is loose and large, not the sticky mass they often give us, like other cereals (although there is good pearl barley that I enjoy eating). Pasta and especially mashed potatoes are a celebration. Rice and buckwheat are also quite rare (not cracked, that is, not broken; any broken cereal is mostly station porridge). Cutlets are small balls, a little larger than dumplings, made from an unclear mince; many get heartburn after these cutlets (Heartburn Central - that's about our cafeteria). If there's chicken cutlet (thin) for lunch, you start to wonder - where does such generosity come from, what kind of celebration is today?

Soups, regardless of their names on the menu, are also a dismal sight - water, a bunch of cabbage, a couple of pieces of potatoes, carrots, onions, etc., no hint of meat, as well as taste. We, the workers, sprinkle this soup with universal seasonings to feel some taste, even though it's a specific chemical taste of a universal seasoning like Maggi or Torchin.

This doesn't apply to borscht - it's made quite well, even without meat, but the borscht is good - probably because it's a national dish.

The chefs themselves, for the most part, prefer to bring food from home rather than eat what they have prepared. However, they can make pasta or mashed potatoes for themselves as a side dish (according to them, the station's 'meat mince' is a disaster).

But I absolutely don't want to offend the chefs - I think most of them sincerely try to make something at least somewhat edible for us with what they have.

I prefer to eat food from home (sausages, quickly cooked cereals and vermicelli, canned meat). 

But, of course, you can't bring a lot of food for your shift (and it's expensive), so I often have to force myself to eat the local 'food' in the cafeteria. And many workers do more or less the same as I do because enduring 10 or 13 days without normal, tasty food, eating slop, is quite challenging

[ Temporary rest areas \(dormitories\) ](https://preview.redd.it/egu9kji9fggc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f03fd1ac7db072eec4c91fc5f5b0458c8f7a65c)

Okay, here I may be exaggerating a bit. During the warm seasons, insects like beetles, spiders, centipedes, and so on, are quite common in the dormitory. But this is unavoidable; buildings converted into dormitories naturally have many gaps in windows and walls (mostly).

I'm just very afraid of insects; the others seem okay with it. Apparently, they aren't particularly bothered by a fear of insects.

During the cold seasons, everything is generally fine; they heat appropriately, which is a plus.

Overall, the dorms are quite good. The dormitory administrators and janitors (by the way, they call janitors ""deactivators"" at the station) do an excellent job. Decorating for the New Year is done without any problems, and it turns out very well. Dealing with heating issues, calling electricians for bulbs, sockets, heating elements on water heaters (and also technologists by the way) - no problems. They will try to solve any other problems too.

The most important thing is that cleaning is done regularly and very well. Clean-ups after alcoholics (vomiting and such) are done without problems. Installing an extra router for internet distribution? No problem! You don't even need to write in the complaints and suggestions journal; just complaining orally is enough. The dorm administrators and their assistants manage things quite well.

But the dormitory is not a home; you have to get used to it. In some rooms, there are 10-15 people, and in others, much fewer, to the point that one person is almost always alone in the room, almost like having personal quarters. But this is if you're lucky to be in that workshop and in that service! Room allocations in the dorms were decided among the workshop chiefs. If you're forced to live in a room with 10-15 colleagues from your workshop, and your colleague from another workshop lives alone in a room - thank your workshop chief and envy them, lol.

Even if you live alone, it's not always easy to get a good night's sleep, especially if you have a sensitive sleep - colleagues wandering the corridor (often drunk) can be heard clearly. Also, upon arrival for a shift, it takes time for a person to get used to the new environment, making it not always easy to fall asleep quickly.

For me, it's quite challenging (although I must say that after arriving at the dorm, I like to watch various videos online, play a popular Chinese game, watch a series of a TV show - why not? Am I some kind of robot that only thinks about work? I want to have personal leisure time too, whatever it is).

And a small clarification: the operational staff works on a 10/10 schedule, while the day shift works on a 13/11 schedule (13 days at work and 11 days at home). Previously, until around the summer of 2023, the day shift worked on a 14/10 schedule - 14 days at work and only 10 days at home.

[ Smoking \(Memories of the occupation of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant by Russian forces\) ](https://preview.redd.it/0qkxei1ffggc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a8dc84ff98d8e3ad3eb89d8b7cb7cf909a6657b)

After the station was occupied, a pressing question about cigarettes arose among the staff. The onset of war, the anxiety for loved ones, attempts to comprehend the chaos unfolding, complete uncertainty about what is happening and what will happen, uncertainty about when you will see and be able to support and embrace your

mother/father/grandfather/grandmother/children/comrades, and whether you will be able to take them away at all—all of this weighed heavily on the psyche, and as a result, there was a desire to smoke more to somehow calm oneself. We were heading for a night 12-hour shift, not anticipating that we would be stuck for almost a month. The cigarette supply of most people ran out in the first few days.

We started breaking into the offices and lockers of our colleagues, made forays into workplaces and Semikhody, with the aim of finding supplies for our colleagues (both cigarettes/tobacco and food, with a focus on sweets, but that will be a separate post). We found and shared, regardless of positions/experience, in a brotherly manner, but it wasn't always enough.

We found cigarette butts and shook out the remaining tobacco from them. Some didn't hesitate to rummage a bit in the garbage at workplaces (please note – some, a quite small minority, from what I could hear). We made roll-ups using tea, both us and Ukrainian soldiers. Approximately in the middle of the occupation, a roll-up made from half tea and half tobacco became a very precious item.

However, we often smoked tea roll-ups; there was no nicotine in them, but at least there was smoke! Finely chopped green tea was perfect for such roll-ups (they said black tea wasn't very good – difficult to smoke). The smell, however, from these roll-ups was specific – like grass, you know, the kind some people enjoy, from what I remember, almost identical or very close to the smell of the ""magical"" herb (I haven't encountered people who enjoy this product much in my environment, but the smell is easily memorable, it's too sharp and distinctive).

[ The number of workers at the ChNPP ](https://preview.redd.it/iloym9bjfggc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d23993754bec9065e06216be8fa109c1431bb480)

Well, from the picture, everything is generally clear. New workers come to us very reluctantly (if they do join us, it's usually through the draft board and their medical commission - it's frightening, despite the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant's (ChNPP) provided reserve from mobilization (although it still needs to be obtained after being hired, and with the draft board, everything works just fine - the medical examination is passed, during wartime - fit for service, but there is still no reserve for him, they didn't manage to process it - bureaucracy! They can quickly draft him to the front, and if a person is mobilized, the reserve sent for him is annulled! These are the legal nuances in legislation).

And they don't particularly want to come to us - it's hard to work now.

Well, there is **no** extra pay for working for two or three (what kind of extra pay is that!? - no, it's better for the director and his deputies to buy themselves an extra fancy car with the 'savings' in such a system).

Result: a severe shortage of workers at the site and facilities at the ChNPP (**please note** \- specifically at the site and facilities at the ChNPP, where there are about 600-650 people, and this year the plan is for 450-500. At the same time, in the Central Technical Support Center (UTsTs) and the office in Slavutich, there are almost 2000 people, if we believe the data and images here: [https://chnpp.gov.ua/images/stories/ChNPP/personal\_2023ua.jpg](https://chnpp.gov.ua/images/stories/ChNPP/personal_2023ua.jpg) \- the number of people at the ChNPP Personnel Department (DSP ChNPP).

[https://ibb.co/vXts2FZ](https://ibb.co/vXts2FZ) \- and those of them who **actually work** are at the station.

And I, as a station worker, fully believe them - these are quite plausible pictures.

How they 'work,' what 'great deeds' they do, in what conditions, and how much alcohol they consume during this - that's a topic for a separate post (and I am sure they drink very well, quite possibly more than us - the shift workers).""

Can I have a moment of your time for an advertisement?

On this [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ChNPPLenjoy), I will continue to cover my work at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, reflect on the 'occupation,' talk about certain individuals (usually from the management), share insights into the concept of 'downtime,' discuss bonuses (both for us regular specialists and the higher-ups in the leadership), delve into the notion of 'at one's own expense,' and under what circumstances all of this takes place. I will also share some interesting facts and peculiarities of working at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. I can still create quite a few posts.

Your support means a lot to me, and I sincerely thank you if you choose to [support](https://www.patreon.com/ChNPPLenjoy) me!

When I got to the epilogue, I realized that the version which plays at the end of the show isn't the version available on the album. In the album version, the only lyrics are ""vichnaya pamyat"", but in the epilogue version (keep in mind I don't speak Russian) it sounds like they say some other things too. The epilogue version is also longer than the album version, with a length of 6 minutes compared to 4 minutes. I've hunted online for the epilogue version, but to no avail. If anyone has any information about this version of the song, like what else the singers are saying, I'd love to hear it!

----------------

how they noticed that  these 40 or 50 fuel channels ruptured before evrything exploded?

what happened to refuelling machine? i saw some photos of the just botom piece with channel to insert/remove fuel rods? where is remaining part?  

where the reactor meltdown began (the hotspot thing) did it cause some fuel rods and control rods fall out of channels into bottom of reactor pit?

The following video is an example of what we occasionally encounter in the Chernobyl exclusion zone.

If you have seen the HBO series this is the area where the fireman had picked up the piece of graphite in his hand and then later showed serious signs from it.

In video one what we are recording is the level of contaminants that are found in their fur. This contamination is all external and can be simply washed off with soap and water. You can see in this video how high the level is. Video 2, this is after they’ve been washed with soap and water and then cleared for    us to be able to handle them. All animals are frisked for radiation contaminants before we even touch them. Then appropriate measures are taken to make sure that we are safe. These puppies were only handled by two specific people and we wore gloves the entire time even after they were washed and removed the contaminants from their fur.

Мені 31 рік. З 16 років у мене почались проблеми з алкоголем і наркотиками. Речовини допомагали мені спілкуватись з людьми і ховати свою інтровертну сутність. В 24 роки мені вдалося вибратись з цієї ями і я потрапив в іншу. Все частіше і частіше у мене почались панічні атаки. Все частіше я не міг налагодити свій сон. Піком було те що я боявся вийти з квартири, бо мені здавалось що зі мною щось станеться. Добре що вже в той час існували доставки продуктів. В якийсь момент я зрозумів, що мій дах поїхав і мені необхідно якось все це врівноважити. Я поспілкувався з подругою і вона порекомендувала мені одного психотерапевта.

Намагався підти, але як тільки підходив, то в мене починались конвульсії, сильний тремор та паніка, я просто задихався і майже втратив свідомість. Коли був на полігоні під час навчання, то втратив свідомість перед стрільбами від паніки (це був 2018 рік). Не можу дивитись на себе в дзеркало, просто немає мінімальної поваги до себе. 

Так, я ухилянт, я нікчема. Я знаю, що не заслуговую на життя, на щастя, на сім‘ю. Думаю над тим, щоб вкоротити собі віку. Але не хочу засмучувати маму і тата. Вони й так втратили все (ми з Луганщини). І ще в додаток у них син чмо. 

Знаю, що за відмову від мобілізацї можуть дати 3-5 років увязнення. Може піду цим шляхом. Чи не знаєте ви, куди таких потвор як я ув‘язнюють? У камери до вбивць, до гвалтівників? Чи є якась класифікація зон?

Ukraine_UA,1al41gn,"Школярі, студенти та інші люди, які вчаться. Які б ви дали собі (ну й іншим) поради стосовно навчання?","Відповіді можуть стосуватися будь-чого, що пов‘язане із навчанням. І загальні, і специфічні для конкретної галузі. Буде дуже цікаво почитати.

Якщо вам цікава відповідь самого автора, то:
1) Стосовно ЗНО/НМТ. Для моєї спеціальності єboшити заради 190+ було ні для чого. На бюджет вступила б і з балом 170-175 (то порада собі, бо на медицину можна і з таким балом вступити абсолютно спокійно)
2) На-уй паритися із-за стипендії. На потоці в нас +- 80 людей. Цього разу я 51. Особливо під час практики я зрозуміла, що витрачати час на те, що буде малокорисним, зовсім не хочеться. Є те, на чому я буду зациклюватися. 
3) Відгуки стосовно універу бувають ДУЖЕ-ДУЖЕ різні. Через людський фактор. Бо одним універ подобається, а хтось у перший тиждень продумує план втечі (причини однакові). 
4) Стосовно рейтингів. Рейтинг універів, як я розумію, робляться на основі критеріїв, пов‘язаних із наукою. Медуніверситет, наприклад, може бути не дуже високо в рейтингу, проте студенти у майбутньому стають прекрасними лікарями. І навпаки. Тому я б не на рейтинг орієнтувалася, бо то фігня.
5) Школярі, забийте болт. Золота медаль, свідоцтво з відзнакою… Це все зовсім не потрібно. Для багатьох, можливо, це очевидно, але точно не для всіх. Десь буде невисокий бал, бо ви готуєтеся до іншого предмету? П О Х У Й.

Дуже цікавий сюжет, важко передбачити куди саме заведе героїв його розгортання. Майстерно прописані характери, я співчував кожному і поганцю і герою.
Розвиток персонажів відбувається скоріше в психологічному ніж в фізичному плані - цим він схожий на Джорджа Мартіна.
Єдиний мінус - дуже багато персонажів, усі здаються важливими, через це довгенько доводиться входити в курс подій, починає затягувати може із 100ї сторінки.

Отож, деякий час (достатньо довгий час) я мав (і досі маю) деякі проблеми з ПК: періодичні просадки в іграх де їх не мало б бути, висока температура та інше. Системник я неодноразово доглядав. Отож я впевнений що проблема в програмній частині, але скажу чесно, я занадто лінивий щоб її шукати. Найбільш імовірним варіантом я вважаю майнер,б о моя цифрова гігієна... гмм... майже відсутня. Звісно я відносно відповідально ставлюся до того що встановлюю і прибираю галочки коли мені пропонують встановити якийсь ""це-не-шкідливе-ПЗ-чесне-слово"" браузер. Але я не гребую встановленням піратського пз та ігор. До сьогодні я не звератв уваги не проблему поки не сталося дещо.

Ukraine_UA,1ajfk9o,Блуї українською. Інша команда озвучки.,"
Нещодавно побачив пост в цьому сабредіті де люди казали що почали озвучувати Bluey і там вийшла навіть перша серія, так ось, ми це робимо вже декілька місяців, озвучили вже 25 серій.

Одразу попереджу, перші серії страждають бо ми тільки розбиралися, крайні серії прям нічого так. 

В відео немає ніякої реклами, посилань і тд і тп, чисто контент. Тож поки всі команди настворюють велику кількість серій - можете подивитися і у нас.

В цілому дуже круто що стільки контенту зараз виходить українською і дуже сподіваюся що це не поодинокий випадок і буде багато конкурующих озвучок для аніме і мультиплікації в цілому, бо наразі дуже багато чого не вистачає і малим дітям важко підібрати щось подивитися.

Ну і трошки про воркфлоу: 
🔵 Переклад робимо з англійської;
використовуємо Davinci Resolve та їх ADR для запису дорожек по міткам;
🔵 Після десь 10 серії це повний дубляж, оригінальну дорожку ми чистимо за допомогою штучного інтелекту (є пара сервісів які ми оплатили щоб використовувати), через це виходить що звуки фону та музика залишаються, а ось голоса прибираються;
🔵 В команді наразі тільки 2 людини, тому для деяких персонажів голоса можуть бути не ок, але ми стараємося. Ми ніяк не промоутимо себе, навіть назви спілки немає, зновуж, ніякої реклами :);
🔵 Всі серії заливаємо в телеграм, де є тільки відео без інших постів, що дозволяє включити відос і дивитися серії без перебивок на картинки/інші пости;
🟠Ps. Перші серії перероблюємо вже, тож поки рекомендую йти з кінця :).

>*24 квітня 1993 року Лондон сколихнула жахлива подія. Вибух бомби, закладеної Ірландською республіканською армією (IRA), спричинив масштабну руйнацію та людські жертви. Це не просто терористичний акт; це було викликом безпеці та стабільності у серці однієї з найвідоміших столиць світу.*

## Місце події та її наслідки

Атака відбулася у фінансовому центрі Лондона, біля вежі Бішопсгейт. Вибух не лише забрав життя однієї людини та поранив понад 40 осіб, але й завдав значних збитків історичним будівлям та інфраструктурі. Економічні втрати оцінювалися в мільярди фунтів.

Місце події, безперечно, впливає на обсяг та специфіку наслідків будь-якої трагічної події чи аварії. Локація, будь то урбанізована міська зона або віддалений природний ландшафт, визначає швидкість реагування рятувальних служб, доступність медичної допомоги та обсяг потенційних збитків. В міських умовах, наприклад, щільна забудова та велика кількість людей можуть призвести до більшої кількості жертв та пошкоджень інфраструктури, тоді як у віддалених районах проблемою може стати відсутність швидкого доступу до необхідної допомоги.

Наслідки події охоплюють широкий спектр впливів, від безпосередніх жертв та матеріальних збитків до довгострокових психологічних, соціальних та економічних наслідків. Матеріальні збитки можуть включати руйнування будівель, інфраструктури, загибель особистого майна. Людські втрати та травми мають глибокий емоційний вплив на родини постраждалих та громаду в цілому. Довгострокові наслідки можуть включати зміни у місцевій економіці, зниження туристичної привабливості регіону, а також зміни у законодавстві та нормах безпеки, спрямовані на запобігання подібним подіям у майбутньому.

Я взагалі ще не бачив щасливих пар.
Якщо відсторонитися від оточення і просто подумати про необхідність стосунків я теж не можу зрозуміти.

Якщо тупо заради сексу, то це не стосунки.

Для продовження роду? Ну може, але я точно не хочу дітей.

Якщо бути разом з кимось, їй постійно потрібно буде приділяти увагу. Йти на компроміси та поступки, задовольняти її потреби (тут я не маю на увазі бути каблуком, в правильних стосунках від другої половини очікується те ж саме)

For the dad, I want to make a collage of pictures from around the world that show support of Ukraine.

If you come across any, can you please comment them and include the location?

I would love anything at all that you come across, subtle or not. I saw a tree in someone’s front yard with a blue and yellow ribbon tied to it and got the idea.

Examples: flag, bumper sticker, sunflower, ribbons, christmas lights and decorations, posters, fireworks, shirts, murals and other art pieces/installations

Thank you so much!

I want to learn Ukrainian. Most of the resources I've found are for a predominantly Anglophone audience, which is something I'm not interested in. Our Ukrainian embassy wasn't helpful in tracking down teachers or courses, and the only formal courses in Ukrainian are the limited number of courses offered by the linguistic collage in my city (something I'm also trying to avoid since I'm in another department and going to classes there would be a last resort).  Also I haven't been able to find a dictionary which is in Ukrainian/Macedonian because it doesn't exist in print i.e. no shop is selling it.   


I was wondering on any advice or tips on learning Ukrainian as a Slavic speaker (while I know that not all Slavic languages are identical or similar, we have a lot of similar words with Ukrainian and some of the grammar structures and sounds are identical).

I’ll tell you this…Ukrainian is just so beautiful. It sounds sort of similar to Spanish, but you know it’s not, because it also sounds sort of like French and Polish and of course, it sounds Slavic. Certain words sound particularly gorgeous and very poetic with accentuation, like доща, слів, ста, хочета, зер це, і зареш. It’s just a beautiful sound, almost like music, and I can see why it’s been compared to a nightingale. I was very surprised how soft it is when I first heard it. Personally, I could tell right away from the beginning that it was not Russian. It’s softer, higher, and just different, like a poem.

I've been reflecting on my heritage lately, and despite having more Russian blood, I feel a strong desire to learn more about Ukrainian language, culture, and history.

I speak fluently Russian, though I was born and raised in France. Since this war started, I feel a deep shame in having this Russian heritage and I would like to learn about Ukraine's history, culture, your language, literature and so on…

I don't really have time since i live alone, i go to the highschool daily and i also work to make a living so there is literally 0 free time but you know, on my break in job maybe i will be able to read few pages here and there. 

My question is, I've never done this before but do you have any tips on how to read it properly? I have one Ukranian workbook where i write words to make sure i remember them, so i think i will just read, the words i won't get i will use translator and then i will write them down?

Ukrainian,1adcma7,"So, uh, I still can't really get the grasp of this","In March last year, I went to Львів. And as any other tourist, I visited Kryivka, need to say, the food is good and when I compare it to stylised restaurants in Prague - it was a really great experience, and chewing down on salo and raw onion with borsch meant a really nice dinner for me. And even though I know that it's touristy and I also went around Львів and found other restaurants that I enjoy, there's just something about saying the password on door and heading down to the basement for a meal that stuck with me.

Well,anyways, in early days of the invasion,me and my friends made a bunch of patches featuring tractors (as in how Ukrainian tractors were towing away Moskal war machines) and so I kept a few of them on me during this visit and after paying, I gave one to the staff, as a token of friendship, or how you want to call it. In return, they gave me one of their own.

It has a skull in an officer's cap, a noose by side and the words, which I'd like to decipher ""прошу пана до гиляки""

As it is obvious, with the noose, I guess it is a snarky, yet polite way to say to someone to go h@ng themselves.

Then again, Wikipedia states that on the Pacific island of Sachalin, there are indigenous Gilyak people, and it would, from my Czech point of view,make sense how we cuss off people, who wrong us, to either sand them to ass ""jdi do prdele"" or to go literally ""somewhere"" - ""jdi někam"". 

And telling a Moskal to go all the way to Sachalin to spend time with indigenous people there, would make sense to how we use profanities, or how we tell people to f@ck off.

Could anyone solve this one for me?

Ukrainian,19dzzqi,Two questions: Learning through games and macOS dictionary,"I have been trying to learn Ukrainian ever since I met my ex a little over a year ago now, since then I have wanted to try connect with more Ukrainians currently staying in my country. Many friendly smiles and head nods but little in the way of conversation, those I call friends we still use translating tools heavily in conversation but they are attending english classes whereas I am going about my normal day.

I actively study daily through Duolingo but finding it is now becoming repeatitive and basic, I still struggle but I feel it is not enough to get over that hurdle.

I bit the bullet and bought Baldur's Gate 3 after reading a guide on its steam page about another user who used it to learn English, from zero to literate. He created a tool called [Lookupper](https://lookupper.com/) which is an extension to the macOS ""Quick Lookup"" feature, while in game I can hover over a word click the keyboard shortcut and in theory displays the dictionary entry.

This is the first hurdle i have ran into, macOS does not come with a Ukrainian dictionary built into its dictionary app so I had to look online to find one and needless to say it is a struggle. I found another application [Dictionaries.io](https://dictionaries.io) that has several dictionaries you can install and I installed the Ukrainian-English dictionary (available for macOS, Windows, and Kindle). Any attempts to look online will lead to online dictionaries or dictionary like tools, or downloadable standalone applications (predomanintly on iOS rather than macOS) but in all cases they do not integrate with the macOS dictionary app directly which hinders the ability to work with [Lookupper](https://lookupper.com/).

The second hurdle I have ran into is that this dictionary ([Dictionaries.io](https://dictionaries.io)) is very limited in some areas and to overloaded in other areas. Some words will have literally no entry requiring a google search or going further an actual translating tool to find the word and definition - taking me out of the game - or in other cases will say that it is a case variant of another word and does not provide any definition leading to looking up another word, and from my study I understand a lot of the Ukrainian letters are also words and terms but [Lookupper](https://lookupper.com/) or [Dictionaries.io](https://dictionaries.io) wlll say it is a letter (I am unsure which is the true source of the information and the issues). Then on the other end of the spectrum some words will have so many meanings and entries that it is so overwhelming to the point of being impossible to actually understand any meaning being conveyed.

So my two questions are:

1. Has anyone used games like **Baldur's Gate 3** \- with many hours with lots of indepth and complex dialogue, text, and choices - to learn Ukrainian, and if they have any tool suggestions for macOS specifically that allows some sort of real-time translation or overlay, or dictionary lookup, and if possible to play the audio on hover too?
2. Does any have any **comprehensive and concise Ukrainian-English dictionary/thesaurus** that can be added to the macOS dictionary app?

Edit:

I found another tool that may work called [MacLinguist](https://maclinguist.com/en), alongside [Lookupper](https://lookupper.com/), this tool seems to do whole sentence translations on hover and key press. It also can do specific translations on text selection. **However upon testing it fails to work within games as it only provides the details of the application itself i.e. ""Baldur's Gate 3 (3840 x 2160) - Metal"" instead of detecting the text on screen, but has an text input option that can be used instead.**

Note: [MacLinguist](https://maclinguist.com/en) is made in Ukraine if that peaks anyone's interest in supporting it.

Mostly it's Youtube channels, because I want to focus on the real spoken language and not sound like a book.

So when I listen to whatever topic, the occasional vulgarisms are very often beeped out. I'm pissed, because it's indeed effective and I wery often don't understand what the creator were trying to say, sometimes loosing the context. Because my parents of course tried not to teach me such words, I only have a basic set, and some of them russian on top of that, which I don't want to use. I think they are an important part of the language and as an adult I can handle knowing them and using them wisely.

Just a little optional childhood story: Another reason why knowing the swear words is a good thing, is to not use anything that may sound close to it. As a child, every year I went to Ukraine to spend my summer vacation with my grandma. I lived in Czechia most of my life so I sometimes used Czech words to supplement what I forgot in Ukrainian. So I forgot that when I am disgusted by something, I should be saying ""фу"". Instead, I was saying ""фуй"", because that's what a czech would say (same meaning). So of course my grandma was upset at me for swearing, but I did't know that what I was saying very closely resembled ""х\_й"". And therefore knowing this could save me a few embarassing moments.",Pipettess,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukrainian/comments/19cvu4d/im_pissed_at_vulgarisms_censorship_i_cant_learn/,/r/Ukrainian/comments/19cvu4d/im_pissed_at_vulgarisms_censorship_i_cant_learn/,23,2024-01-22 13:39:26,31,,False,0.93,None,2024-02-09 21:08:07.599969

Ukrainian,19bdb3v,"How would I translate the phrase ""Home Stitched"" into Ukrainian?","Privit all! I'm making a Ukrainian short film and one of my most important jobs right now is to translate the title, ""Home Stitched"".

In English, I have three meanings for the title: 

1. It implies someone is stitched TO their home. As if there is a thread that ties someone to where they're born 
2. It implies someone was stitched AT their home. Like the term ""Homemade"" 
3. It is sort of a play on words as it sounds kind of like ""Homesick"" 

The film is about my partner's move to Western Europe from Ukraine and how she still misses home and feels culturally attached to Ukraine despite spending a long time in the west. I've asked her and many Ukrainian friends about this title without consensus. They have proposed these options (I'll order them from the title I'm most confident about to the title I'm least confident about): 

&#x200B;

1. Помережана домом
2. Пронизана домом
3. Домошита 

I think the top one might be the best title. But I'm really hesistant to commit to until I know it definitely sounds good and ""poetic"" in Ukrainian. Obviously, I won't be able to translate all my three meanings, but if I can at least translate meaning number 1., ""Stitched TO home"", that would be great!

Ukrainian,19b8mjq,I need to translate something for my Ukrainian coworker who doesn't speak my language.,"Redditors, I need your help. It will be a long read but this is really important.

I have a Ukrainian coworker who doesn't speak my language. She has a very, very basic knowledge and no understanding whatsoever of my language, to such extent that whatever few things she can say, she says it phonetically, as a simple string of sounds that she learned by heart without being able to identify and isolate the different words composing the sentence she pronounces.

Nobody blames her, we know how hard it is for her to live in a foreign, unknown country, and I want to add that we all like her very much and that her hard-working personality is a subject of admiration among us, as are her kindness and humour praised.

It does create issues, though, as much to her than to us. We can't understand each others and this is not only frustrating, it is also a problem at work. I took upon myself to ask my boss to modify my shifts so that my 30mn break will happen at the time she quits, allowing us to have a 30mn lesson each day.

However, she doesn't understand what I am teaching her and refuses to follow what I planned, telling me ""I know verb X, no need for lessons about it"". She wants immediate results and doesn't let me start with the beginning.

This is where I need your help. I am not able to say such a complex thing in Ukrainian and would like you to translate a sentence that I will write here.

Here it is : ""X, I know it is frustrating to not be given immediately the answers to your questions. However, you will not be able to speak, to understand what is said to you nor to reply to it if you don't know how to form a sentence. This is why we need to start with the beginning : some vocabulary, how to form a sentence, how to conjugate a verb, how to agree an adjective. Even if, at first, you don't get why I give a certain lesson, let me give it anyway and you will soon enough understand the reason why. You aren't the first person I teach my language to and I need you to trust me.""

With this, I hope she will understand that I know what I am doing and that she has support from us. It is important, she is struggling and need some help.

YUROP,1am81wq,world energy record of 69 megajoules set by European scientists,"**European scientists have set a record for the amount of energy generated from nuclear fusion, another sign of progress in a decades-long effort to produce power by harnessing the reaction that powers the sun.**

Researchers at the Joint European Torus facility outside Oxford generated 69 megajoules from a sustained fusion reaction lasting five seconds — enough energy to boil about 70 kettles — surpassing their previous record of 59 megajoules set in 2021.

The latest achievement came in December during the final set of experiments to be conducted at JET, which will be decommissioned this year.

But scientists remain a long way from harnessing fusion power to make it commercially viable. The JET experiment in December consumed far more power than the reaction produced. To build a power station, scientists and engineers must also figure out how to sustain the reactions for longer.

A collaboration between EU member states, Switzerland, the UK and Ukraine, JET has been the world’s largest, most powerful operational “tokamak” machine since it became operational in 1983 and set its first record for energy output in 1997.

The tokamak design, pioneered by Soviet scientists in the 1950s, uses powerful magnets to hold a plasma of two hydrogen isotopes — deuterium and tritium — in place as it is heated to temperatures hotter than the sun so that the atomic nuclei fuse, releasing energy

JET is due to be replaced by a UK programme, known as the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) project, to be built on the site of a decommissioned coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire.
The government hopes STEP will become one of the first fusion machines in the world to supply power to the grid by the early 2040s.

**Japan, with the support of the European Union - World's Largest Nuclear Fusion Reactor opened**

The world’s biggest operational experimental nuclear fusion reactor – a technology in its infancy but billed by some as the answer to humanity’s future energy needs – has been inaugurated in Naka, Japan.

Fusion differs from fission, the technique used in nuclear power plants, by fusing two atomic nuclei instead of splitting one.

The goal of the JT-60SA reactor is to investigate the feasibility of fusion as a safe, large-scale and carbon-free source of net energy – with more energy generated than is put into producing it.

It is a joint project between the European Union and Japan, and is the forerunner for its big brother in France, the under-construction International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

YUROP,1alqde0,Створення офісу МКС в Україні – новий рівень співпраці України та МКС," ***14*** ***вересня цього року Прокурор Міжнародного кримінального суду Карім Хан та Генеральний прокурор України Андрій Костін оголосили про початок роботи Офісу Міжнародного кримінального суду в Україні (Офіс МКС). Це стало новим кроком у співпраці України та МКС з метою забезпечення ефективного міжнародного кримінального правосуддя.***

Офіс МКС в Україні (його ще називають «польовий офіс» або «крайовий офіс» від англійського «country office») створено з метою сприяння роботі МКС на території України у зв’язку з усіма ситуаціями та справами, що перебувають на розгляді Суду, але в першу чергу задля забезпечення ефективного розслідування та притягнення до відповідальності осіб, винних у вчиненні міжнародних злочинів під час російської агресії.

Такі офіси, по суті представництва МКС, створюються в країнах, де відбуваються або відбувались події, що розслідуються Офісом Прокурора МКС. Крім України, такі офіси відкриті в Демократичній Республіці Конго, Уганді, Центральноафриканській Республіці, Кот-д’Івуарі, Грузії та Малі. Основна їх ціль – підтримка мандату Суду та його відповідної діяльності у цих країнах. Також польові офіси в МКС сприяють його взаємодії з інститутами громадянського суспільства та посиленню просвітницької роботи у відповідних країнах.

Однак слід розуміти, що створення офісу МКС в України, це не стільки забезпечення персоналу МКС відповідним приміщенням, скільки цілий комплекс зобов’язань, які взяла на себе Україна відповідно до [Угоди між Кабінетом Міністрів України та Міжнародним кримінальним судом](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/en/980_001-23?lang=uk#Text), вчиненої 23 березня 2023 року.

Серед таких зобов’язань: забезпечення безпеки і захисту приміщень МКС в Україні; забезпечення безпеки, охорони та захисту персоналу та співробітників МКС, а також членів їх сімей; надання МКС таких привілеїв, імунітетів та пільг, які є необхідними для досягнення його цілей; надання необхідних можливостей зв’язку та комунікації; звільнення МКС від податків, імпортних та експортних зборів; сприяння роботі МКС у питаннях митного оформлення, реєстрації автомобілів та видачі дипломатичних номерів, отримання віз або дозволів на в’їзд/виїзд тощо. Остаточна відповідальність за виконання таких зобов’язань, покладається на Уряд України.

**Створення крайового офісу є очікуваним продовженням ефективної співпраці України та МКС**

Можна виділити такі основні прояви співпраці України та МКС:

* 19 листопада 2006 року України приєдналась до [Угоди про привілеї та імунітети Міжнародного кримінального суду](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/995_f62#Text). Україна стала першою державою, яка не є учасником Римського статуту, яка ратифікувала Угоду про привілеї та імунітети МКС, що полегшує співпрацю з МКС.
* Україна визнала юрисдикцію МКС відповідно до частини 3 статті 12 [Римського Статуту](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/995_588#Text). Так, Верховна Рада України двічі зверталась до МКС: 25 лютого 2014 року – із [заявою](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/790-18#Text) про визнання юрисдикції МКС щодо скоєння злочинів проти людяності вищими посадовими особами держави, які призвели до особливо тяжких наслідків та масового вбивства українських громадян під час мирних акцій протестів у період з 21 листопада 2013 року по 22 лютого 2014 року; 4 лютого 2015 року – із [заявою](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/145-19#Text) про визнання Україною юрисдикції Міжнародного кримінального суду щодо скоєння злочинів проти людяності та воєнних злочинів вищими посадовими особами Російської Федерації та керівниками терористичних організацій «ДНР» та «ЛНР», які призвели до особливо тяжких наслідків та масового вбивства українських громадян.
* Офіс Генерального прокурора активно співпрацює з МКС. Так, у січні 2020 року в складі Офісу Генерального прокурора створено Департамент нагляду у кримінальних провадженнях щодо злочинів, вчинених в умовах збройного конфлікту – перший спеціалізований структурний підрозділ, уповноважений на співробітництво з МКС.
* Зі свого боку, крім власне розслідування фактів воєнних злочинів та злочинів проти людяності, МКС сприяє підвищенню обізнаності громадянського суспільства та посиленню професійної спроможності представників юридичної спільноти. Так, [13 – 16 березня 2023 року](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/cooperation/icc-victims-and-witnesses-section-training-public-prosecutors-and-police) МКС провів для співробітників Генеральної прокуратури України та Національної поліції України тренінг із захисту свідків та підтримки жертв сексуального насильства, пов’язаного з війною в Україні.

**Разом з тим, найбільш довго очікуваним продовженням ефективної співпраці України та МКС є ратифікація Україною** [**Римського статуту**](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/995_588#Text)

Україна [підписала](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ShowMTDSGDetails.aspx?src=UNTSONLINE&tabid=2&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&lang=en) Римський статут ще 20 січня 2000 року. Однак його ратифікації перешкодив [висновок Конституційного Суду України](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/v003v710-01#Text), відповідно до якого стаття 1 Статуту не узгоджуються з положеннями частин першої, третьої статті 124 Конституції України, а тому приєднання України до цього Статуту відповідно до частини другої статті 9 Конституції України можливе лише після внесення до неї відповідних змін. У зв’язку із чим стаття 124 Конституції була викладена в новій редакції, яка дозволила визнання Україною юрисдикції МКС на умовах, визначених Римським статутом. Ці зміни набули чинності 30 червня 2019 року. Тож наразі перешкоди ратифікації Римського статуту відсутні.

*У світі, USAID є однією з провідних установ у сфері розвитку, яка виконує роль каталізатора цих процесів та допомагає досягати позитивних результатів. Діяльність USAID є проявом доброчинності американського народу, а також підтримує просування країн-отримувачів допомоги до самостійності та стійкості та сприяє забезпеченню національної безпеки та економічного добробуту США. Партнерські стосунки з Україною USAID підтримує з 1992 року; за цей час, загальна вартість допомоги, наданої Україні з боку Агентства, склала понад 3 млрд доларів США. До поточних стратегічних пріоритетів діяльності USAID в Україні належать зміцнення демократії та механізмів досконалого врядування, сприяння економічному розвитку та енергетичній безпеці, вдосконалення систем охорони здоров’я та пом’якшення наслідків конфлікту у східних регіонах.

ukrcult,t21lob,Soviet patriotic songs are finally describing reality. They tell about Ukrainian heroism.,"Dear Ukrainians,

First and foremost: I'm Polish citizen and as little as it counts I stand with you with my thoughts and am going to protest in front of Russian embassy. I admire your courage and sympathize with you. May Putin's oligarchy die without sons.

I am fan of soviet military music. They are propaganda pieces of terrible regime, that's true. But they are often beautiful, hopeful songs that gave me personally lots of strength in personal hardships.

Many of these songs talk about war. War of defense that is determined and just sacrificial struggle against forces of evil. Many of them refer to WWII, the „sacred war” of soviets. But even in this context they are pure hypocrisy, as we are all aware of Stalin's tyranny and that war on eastern front wasn't war of good versus evil, but between two evil states with suffering of millions innocent people.

In spite of that while listening today to famous song „Sacred War”, I realized how well it describes your current struggle. To quote from its first stanzas:

&#x200B;

Rise up, great country,

Stand up for deathly fight!

Against the dark power of fascists,

Against the damned horde!

&#x200B;

May the noble rage

Boil like wave

Here comes war of the people,

Sacred war!

&#x200B;

We will give push to stranglers

Of all fiery ideas,

To the rapists, the robbers,

To the torturers of the people!

&#x200B;

There are many strong emotions I felt upon this realization. A bit of disbelief. Irony for sure. Disgust towards Russian hypocrites that could surely sing this song seeing themselves as heroes.

But I also felt hope. Admiration. Sympathy. Respect. All that towards you, brave Ukrainians, who fight against odds, who fight just and righteous war against the evil invader.

Please don't misunderstand, I don't mean empty admiration for your suffering or glorification of war. War is hell. Whether you fight or emigrate I still see you as people who were dealt terrible cards in game of history and are doing your best to keep Ukraine alive, whether as fields of wheat or as diaspora of individuals in EU with Ukraine in your hearts.

I only quoted one song, but I found dozens famous soviet pieces that could represent you even without change in lyrics. I find „March of defenders of Moscow” as especially relevant (with exchanging Moscow to Kyiv). Many stanzas of this song are so well describing current heroic defense of capital.

&#x200B;

We will not falter in the battle for our capital,

Our native Kiev is dear to us.

With an unbreakable wall (of us) and defensive steel

We will defeat and destroy the enemy!

&#x200B;

Nearly all soviet songs mention great leader of some sorts – mostly Stalin or one of his generals. These leaders are said to be heroically leading people, even from front line. We all know how untrue and fantastical is that from history.

But you have your hero president that does exactly that. You have many statesmen that took arms with him. Let that fact speak for itself.

Thank you if you made it through this longish post. I also apologize if I offended someone, I know that taking any ideas from soviet union seams crazy in this situation. At the end, please mind I only took words, not concepts

Finally, although I wrote only English translations above, these lyrics fit phonetically with small tweaks and it is same for dozens of songs. I fancy idea that reworking them and recording corrected versions could be quite a punch for Russian propaganda. It is certainly above my individual capabilities, but I'd gladly join others if this idea is worthy.


Stay strong and safe.

May Putin's oligarchy die without sons.

Glory to the Ukraine!",Nuclear_Hypnotoad,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukrcult/comments/t21lob/soviet_patriotic_songs_are_finally_describing/,/r/ukrcult/comments/t21lob/soviet_patriotic_songs_are_finally_describing/,1,2022-02-26 16:59:05,5,,False,0.85,None,2024-02-09 21:08:10.431292

English lyrics:

**It was better**

A Cossack met marvellous girl

In the green Ukraine

Hey girl, where are you came from?

You cool the heat in my heart

In the west, the sun going down

There's where your girlfriend came from

She cries her eyes out

Maybe she will regret it

&#x200B;

It was better, It was better not to charm

It was better, it was better not to try

It was better, It was better not to kiss

Say you, Say you love me

&#x200B;

Fly song to the foreign countries

Somewhere to the Vistula, above the groves

There is the girl

she 's longing, crying

Maybe I'll see her

Think, think my Cossack

Where your girl 's crying

For love and joy

She wants to see you

&#x200B;

It was better ...

&#x200B;

My Mother, dear Mother

What the girl did to me

I cannot live much longer without her

I have to go

A Polish girl did it to me

My girlfriend is Polish

In Poland I will find my heart

I'm going, Mother

&#x200B;

It was better ...

&#x200B;

He found love, he found peace

A circle of friends always around him

He get to known a country where the brooks

Are singing glory to God

Love 's difficult, love hurts

Out of this longing, of this misery

In the green Ukraine

Love will not be lost

&#x200B;

It was better ...

&#x200B;

Our brothers, dear brothers

What we have done together

We were supposed to celebrate together

And fight together

&#x200B;

It was better ...",Deer-Unlucky,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlavicMusicVideos/comments/11eo3ay/bayer_full_lepiej_było_polandpolish/,/r/SlavicMusicVideos/comments/11eo3ay/bayer_full_lepiej_było_polandpolish/,0,2023-02-28 23:51:26,1,,False,0.67,None,2024-02-09 21:08:11.674132

ukraina,1aiop9i,"Справжня зірка Євробачення в Україні Катерина Заботкіна про свій ""вірусний"" успіх","""Маленькі кроки привели до здійснення великої мрії. Вчора в ефірі Національного відбору Євробачення-2024 я виконувала пісні жестовою мовою. 

Ще два роки тому ця мрія здавалась абсолютно космічною, майже нейздісненною. Нацвідбір тоді ніхто не перекладав, це було відсутнє, як опція, а у світі жестової мови я — самоучка. 

У 16 років я дуже надихнулась світом жестової мови і почала вивчати її по відеоуроках. Перші рухи були дуже невпевненими, руки були зовсім не підготовлені до цього, але пристрасть до жестової мови настільки мотивувала, що я дійшла до виконання пісень, перших відео, перших концертів. Пройшло майже 10 років. І ось вчора на студії, де відбувалася трансляція нацвідбору, я дивилась на маленький екранчик на режисерському моніторі, і бачила себе. І зрозуміла, що та маленька дівчинка, яка дивилась відеоуроки жестової мови у кімнаті і тренувалась перед дзеркалом щодня, дійшла до великої сцени українського Євробачення. 

Виконання пісень Національного відбору — для мене величезна честь. Роками українську культуру знищували — її забороняли, за неї карали, прищеплювали комплекс меншовартості, робили все, щоб ми не могли змоги оцінити, наскільки неймовірна наша українська творчість. Зараз в Україні велика кількість надзвичайних і талановитих артистів, які пишуть українську музику в абсолютно різних стилях. Знайомити нечуючих людей з цією частиною нашої культури — музикою — надважливо. Як і бути всім разом у прийнятті цих всеукраїнських творчих рішень щодо вибору кандидата. 

Я дякую вам за цю шалену підтримку і увагу до важливої соціальної місії. Коли ввечері я вийшла зі студії і в мене почав працювати звʼязок, я була просто шокована її кількістю! Дякую усім, хто підтримав репостами, коментарями та публікаціями популяризацію жестової мови. І мемами:) 

Я дякую талановитій колезі Олі, з якою разом були у  студії Нацвідбору. Оля наживо перекладала усі розмовні студії — усі репліки та діалоги суддів, журі, учасників — сходу, тільки на слух. Це фантастично!

Дякую Євробачення Україна за можливість здійснити свою мрію і популяризувати жестову мову. За можливість показувати власний погляд на пісні.

Турбота у жестах. Памʼятайте.""

ukraina,1aif9iz,"Україна: чужа земля, моя єдина домівка.","Спочатку я хочу почати з вибачення за мою погану мову. Я не є рідним мовцем української. Російської я не вмію, але, як правило, можу розуміти її. Чесно кажучи, я використовував Google Translate для словникового запасу. Я просто американець без родинних зв'язків з Україною. Хоча це очевидно, я визнаю, що я залишаюсь американцем, і моя перспектива є іноземною. І я розумію, що мій стиль письма відображає те, що я не є рідним українським мовцем чи слов'янином.  Мої наміри писати тут для мене не зовсім зрозумілі. Загалом я хочу чути вас всіх у вашій мові. Я хочу отримати поради від українців, з якими я не маю знайомства чи взаємодії. Мені байдуже, якою мовою ви користуєтеся. Якщо я не зможу вас зрозуміти, мені допоможе Google або друг. Але будь ласка, пишіть мовою, якою вам найзручніше користуватися.

&#x200B;

Я не вірю в долю чи містицизм. Проте моє життя неодноразово направляло мене в бік України. Мій університетський ступінь почався як політологія, зосередженою виключно на Європі, з спеціалізацією на політиці Східної Європи. Однак я не міг пройти курси російської мови і прийняв більш загальний шлях до кар'єри в ЄС. Тим не менше, працюючи в Європі, я закохався в українку. Ми жили в Західній Європі, але мені пощастило провести півроку в її рідному місті, де я зрозумів, що ця країна надзвичайно особлива. Моя любов до України протривала і після закінчення нашого відносин. Фактично я зрозумів, що бачу своє майбутнє в Україні, тоді як вона бачила своє в Європі, тому після розриву я був вільний повністю інвестувати в життя там. Однак я залишаюся вдячним за ті досвіди, які я здобув через неї. Я бачив Україну такою, якою вона є, нефільтрованою, з усіма суперечностями, потенціалом і красою.

Українці завжди говорили зі мною прямо, тому, хоча я не маю наміру образити когось, я буду говорити прямо про свої перші враження.  Моя перша пряма зустріч з Україною була відвідування міста колишньої дівчини, Херсона. Херсон показав мені парадокс, що визначив саме те, що я бачив в Україні.

&#x200B;

\-На поверхні Херсон не є найкрасивішим містом, також я отримав попередження від колишньої дівчини і її сім'ї, що це також небезпечне місце через серйозну проблему організованої злочинності. Я знаю зі свого навчального досвіду, що Україна має проблеми із системною корупцією, і мій перший досвід це підтвердив. Громадський транспорт працював в теорії. Моя робоча угода була також теоретичною.   Люди  розмовляли майже виключно російською, навіть коли я використовував українську і, очевидно, не розумів російської.

Однак я зіткнувся із багатьма іншими речами:

\- Ці люди часто високо цінили, що я роблю зусилля вивчати і говорити з ними на українській мові, незалежно від того, якою мовою вони користувались.

\- Українці, а особливо люди в Херсоні, гордяться тим, ким вони є, і своєю історією. Вони пишаються своєю історією та своєю ідентичністю.

\- Україна не є країною, що розвивається. Вона повністю розвинена. В деяких областях ви можете отримати краще в Україні, ніж в більшості країн ЄС чи США (якщо ви не багаті).

\- Україна має високоосвічене суспільство та розвинений промисловий сектор з обширною інфраструктурою, яка великою мірою не визнається на Заході.

\- Україна має соціальну мобільність. Ви можете радикально змінити своє життя там. Місцеві не бачили цього так, як я, але я наполягаю, що Україна дозволяє це відчути краще, ніж США чи Європа.

\- Найбільш помітні області, де Україна часто перевищує європейські стандарти, - це охорона здоров'я та якість їжі. Україна надавала набагато більш докладну охорону здоров'я, ніж Іспанія, Ірландія чи Чеська Республіка, і була набагато дешевше за США.

\- Кожен, кого ти зустрічаєш, стає твоїм другом на один день у моїй країні. Кожен друг, якого ти зробиш в Україні, буде твоїм другом на роки. Вам не потрібно бути кимось іншим, ви можете бути тим, хто ви є. Усмішки є відвертими. Якщо ви запитаєте, як себе почувають, вони вам скажуть, як вони себе почувають.

\- Українці - жорстокі захисники демократії, яку вони будують. Бути незалежним та мати країну для людей - це недостатньо для них. Українці, з якими я зустрічався, не були пишні тим, *що просто права* їм дозволяється висловлювати критику своїх проблем. **Натомість вони критичні, не задоволені корупцією та вважають, що їм не слід приховувати проблеми, які вони мають.**

Я розумію, що не можу змінити ситуацію. Мені втомило кричати у порожнечу. Проте я продовжуватиму, доки не зможу справити певний вплив. Мені дуже важко дивитися, як мої друзі страждають, і я не можу нічого зробити. Це ще більше погіршується через те, що я не страждаю разом з ними.

Пишу у відчаї, оскільки не можу жити з собою, коли мені так комфортно, хоча бачу, як мої друзі змінюються: від громадян до військових, старші сестри стають єдиними опікунами своїх братів і сестер, від гордих до біженців, що визначало як українця \*, до визначення іншими як українця

\*\* (я б хотів сказати ""which/whom chose to define themselves as Ukrainian, into people whom others defined as Ukrainian"").

Життя жорстке і несправедливе, але те, що відбувається, повинно бути неприйнятним для світу, навіть якщо зупинити це - величезний ризик.

Отже, я питаю всіх вас, як ви виживаєте, як можучи змінити ситуацію? Чи є у вас які-небудь поради стосовно того, що я можу зробити, чи як ви бачите цю ситуацію? Я не цікавлюся вдячністю, визнанням чи увагою. В іншому випадку я б написав це на r/ukraine або в іншій англомовній області. Я хочу чесний діалог, навіть якщо мені не подобається те, що мені говорять. Я не просю допомоги зі своїми почуттями, я просю місця, куди я можу направити цю енергію, де я можу вплинути на людей.  Я часто подорожую до України і маю професійний досвід у зборі коштів урядових організацій, неприбуткових організацій і пишу професійно англійською мовою. Якщо ви не бажаєте говорити публічно, але маєте ідеї, напишіть мені особисто.

Хочу виказати свою думку з цього приводу, як волонтера, який 24/7 вже десять років у війні.

  
На мій погляд оці істеричні заклики ""всі з тилу в окопи"" це повна фігня. Зараз спробую пояснити, чому маю саме таку думку. 

  
Не всі хто в тилу - ухилянти!   


Ви не уявляєте скількох дієвих в тилу чоловіків я особисто вмовляла не йти добровільно служити, бо розумію, що від нього толку в тилу ДЛЯ АРМІЇ набагацько більше ніж в окопах. І це факт. 

  
Нажаль наша влада не готувалася до повномасштабного вторгнення, а навпаки з 2019 року робила все для того, щоб скоротити військо, завалити забезпечення та з гаслами ""какая разніца"" та масовими сфабрикованими звинуваченнями в кримінальних справах тулили військових, ветеранів та волонтерів в ряди злодіїв. 

  
Це після 2022 року всі дружно повряхувалися в оливу та понтуються на всіх державних рівнях які вони захисники, а от до цього часу в нас же війни не було. І хз звідки в нас майже 20000 загиблих з 2014-го року. 

  
Це я до чого... По забезпеченню - срака! Повна срака. І щоб вам там не казали в тому ""марафоні"", я добре знаю яке забезпечення тих, хто в окопах! Особливо це стосується стрілецьких батальйонів та ТРО, які реально воюють. Тільки не треба мені тут будь ласка зараз розповідати про те , що воюють виключно круті бригади, а оті всі ТРО та стрільчаки то неякісна бойова сила. Я знаю різні випадки!   
І от в мене питання, якщо забрати ВСІХ чоловіків з тилу, яким поголовно ліплять тавро ""ухілянт"", то що отримає в підтримку фронт? А ніхуя, бо жінки в тилу самотужки не вивезуть все на собі, і заробляння коштів, і виробництва, і допомогу. Ніколи не вивезуть. Щоб вам там безугла не пизділа. 

  
Я вам приведу приклад власного досвіду. В мене на складі пашуть, окрім їх основної роботи, щоб прокормити себе та свої родини, 5 хлопців. Так, троє з них не призивного  віку, але я задовбалася їх мотивувати тим, що без них наша Команда та склад припине існування, бо ми з [Наталя Шкіндер](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100015247387459&__cft__[0]=AZWqj87LZAqnwJ_WxbPjzNja8fa-tpwenMrSayxJEQaEijyn9wJrxvRyMKvv7YTbr8cMpplm42d1gb5okO_Lx8kaWCm_l1aB_e9UFdbV6AdJ5GPHIneKn7U88eww0ZWETyY7aecNL7LLMbv5Z-cLmuJU&__tn__=-]K-R) не витягнемо самотужки щоденно сотні кілограмів допомоги перетягувати з пошти на пошту та пакувати ті палети.

Якщо ви почнете зараз умнічати що ""можно найняти когось"", то в мене питання - КОГО, якщо ж всіх в окопи? І ще спробуйте знайти когось, хто б безвідмовно БЕЗКОШТОВНО в'ябував на холодному складі пакуючи нескінченні посилки та палети на фронт. 

  
Сподіваюся пояснила вам, бо я знаю, як лупаше по мозгам моїм хлопцям оце ""а чого ти не в окопах?"". 

  
Я можу привести купу прикладів, коли від де яких чоловіків в тилу більше толку ніж в окопах. І кожному з них оце ""ухилянт"" лупаше по мозгам! Ви ж всі так лайкаєте та дякуєте дописи наприклад, де я дякую «Санті» за чергову допомогу фронту колесами та іншими потужними речами, які він передає підрозділам з власних коштів. Дохєра жінок передадуть тих коліс, якщо його заберуть в окопи? Держава забезпечить? Балалайку! 

  
Так, звісно в нас в тилу купа чуваків, які ніхєра не роблять за для підтримки війська та економіки країни. Які мають чудову фізичну форму бо віджимають десятки кг в тренажерках і все що можуть це в тіктоках набирають лайки прихильниць. Я знаю навіть чувака, який призивного віку ховається від ТЦК, але з радістю б здав свого сина непризивного віку замість себе, хоча має навіть нарізну зброю, бо по зайчикам пуляти йому цікавіше ніж по оркам. Не так сцикотно. 

  
Випадки бувають різні.

  
Мене наприклад більше бентежать не ""ухилянти"", а та шалена кількість отказників СЗЧешників, які залишають позиції разом зі зброєю оркам, кидаючи Побратимів і з'ябуються з виправдовуванням ""краще сидітиму на зоні, але живий"". І таких насправді овердохєра.

  
От вони для мене сцикуни та ухилянти однозначно. І особливо гидко, коли такі ховаються по підвалах і записують сльозні відосики ""Нас всі кинули! Допомоги немає! Зброї немає!"" і сердобольні дамочки, у яких ""серце розривається"" таскають мені в меседжери свої соплі з проханням ""допоможіть хлопчикам""! 

  
Не всі підряд повинні воювати.  Багато в тилу тих, без чиєї допомоги та роботи фронт загнеться к хєрам за місяць! Залишити на жинок країну це маразм! Є купа професій, які жінки не подужають, є купа ситуацій з якими жінки в тилу не справляться.""

Час від часу згадую одну карточну гру, яку ще малим знайшов десь у бабусі, і яку вона дозволила залишити в себе. Набір карт був неповний, правил теж не було, - просто пара десятків карт в пакетику. Декілька років назад я згадав про цю гру, і тоді я пам'ятаю що ""щось десь заходив"", але можливо то був пост такого ж ""шукача"". І ось я знов, як то кажуть, ""з ніфіга"", згадав про цю тричі кляту гру. Цього разу, хоч у мене тепер нема на руках тих карт (вдома залишились, а сам я поїхав через пів країни самі розумієте чому), пошуки були дещо успішнішими - я дізнався назву та деяку інформацію про гру. Всі фото, що вдалося знайти, додаю. Можливо хтось тут знає більше про цю гру, і може щось розповісти про неї, бо я був дуже здивований її... ""обскурністю"".  Хоча можливо я просто погано шукав.

ukraina,1adtl9p,Are Ukrainian translations of games made by Western indie (not AAA) developers terrible?,"I was playing Trepang 2 on PC, upon switching the interface language to Japanese for learning practice, I can't even surpass the fact that the translation is outright garbage, as if the developers just copied and pasted the text via Google Translate, plus the subtitles are bad (as it only had English dub) and translated literally instead of being adaptive to the target language due to the inconsistency of the font (it also shifts from one font type to another as in English it's not bold as in Japanese all of the text is in bold), the size of the Kanji is illegible to read since the font they've used is small on top of the shitty translation, for instance the pronoun あなた is present in like every sentence when characters keep saying 'you' but there is a thing about subject omission in Japanese which it's not  like English that it's required.

For example, the most literal translation for the main player (from that game) in Japanese was 被験体106号 *(Суб'єкт 106)* made me laugh as I knew it's dog-shit google translate quality. They definitely pushed the text through Google Translate (bad idea for any language!) for the entire game as the text  feels unnatural as the lines are too long, for me as both the player and reader to catch up. I definitely reverted back to the source language as the translation is crap just to fully understand, as everything was translated literally word-for-word which is the laziest way to localize anything in general.

ukraina,19f9xo1,"I e Ukrainian craft beer, can't wait to try it.","Hi, sorry I don't speak Ukrainian. I'm a vocal supporter of your fight and  national cause and a long standing hater of the Russian state. I donate to pro Ukraine causes etc and I'm determined to play my small part in a Ukrainian victory. I never thought I could combine that with my passion for craft beer of all things but recently a shop in the Netherlands which ships to the UK recently got a delivery of Ukrainian beer so I had to get some.

A beer called HLEB by Pravda brewery is giving the proceeds to an organization helping to bake bread for the men and women on the front line. I wish I had known that so I could have got more. Now I know it exists, I'll be loooking into how to help them more.

For my fellow beer geeks. I also got a few hazy IPAs and an interesting looking Scotch Ale. Interesting because I'm Scottish and I want to see what a Ukrainian interpretation of it would be like. Varva once teamed up with a brewery local to me to make a Scotch Ale with lager yeast and I loved it so I'm really fascinated to see how this turns out. The breweries I have are Pravda, Ten Men and Rebrew. Do you know them? I follow some people on Untappd from Ukraine and they check in beer from those breweries all the time so would I be right in thinking they are well-known in Craft Beer circles at least?

Update from my previous post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraina/s/OV8ogMhKV1

This is a poem by Tara Shevchenko. 

""Сонце заходить, гори чорніють,

Пташечка тихне, поле німіє.

Радіють люде, що одпочинуть,

А я дивлюся... і серцем лину

В темний садочок на Україну.

Лину я, лину, думу гадаю,

І ніби серце одпочиває.

Чорніє поле, і гай, і гори,

На синє небо виходить зоря.

Ой зоре! зоре! — і сльози кануть.

Чи ти зійшла вже і на Украйні?

Чи очі карі тебе шукають

На небі синім? Чи забувають?

Коли забули, бодай заснули,

Про мою доленьку щоб і не чули.""

English translation by Vera Rich

""The sun sets, and dark the mountains become,

The little bird hushes, the plain has grown dumb,

The people rejoice that slumber is nearing,

And I look : and I fly with my heart in my dreaming 

To a dark orchard in far Ukraina;

I fly there, I fly there, pondering deeply,

And it seems that my heart is at rest, has grown tranquil. 

Dark shadows spread over plain, mountain and grove,

A star twinkles out in the blue, high above: 

Star, O Star! —and the bitter tears rain —

And hast thou, then, risen too, over Ukraine?

Do the dark eyes search for thee yet 
In the blue heavens? Or did they forget?

May they slumber forever if they have forgotten,

Never to hear of my pitiful fortune.""",JacquelineorJames,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19f77ci,/r/ukraina/comments/19f77ci/ukrainian_cursive_practice_poem_by_tara_shevchenko/,33,2024-01-25 11:26:38,203,,False,0.99,Made in Ukraine,2024-02-09 21:08:13.489609

ukraina,19ebdab,Ukraine tax question,"Looking for someone that can help me with a tax doubt I have. I'll try to be as informative and concise as possible. 

I'm a foreigner that has been living in Ukraine for a few years. Last year I sold my house in my country of origin. Received the funds in my country of origin's bank account. As far as I'm aware I have to pay tax in Ukraine, which amounts to 18% + 1.5% of the total value I received from the sale, which falls under the foreign income cathegory (cost basis was 0$ because I inherited this house, before moving to Ukraine). 

Now, if I transfer these taxed funds to my Ukrainian bank account, do I have to pay another 19.5% tax on them? All I can find online is this quote from the PrivatBank website:

"" **What types of transfers are included in the taxable income?**

For citizens of Ukraine, the amounts of transfers received from abroad (regardless of the method of receiving a transfer, i.e. crediting to the current (including card) account, in cash)) are the income on which you have to pay personal income tax. That means, the foreign income is the amount of the received international money transfer via any system (including SWIFT system, transfer systems such as Western Union, MoneyGram, etc., card systems such as VISA, MasterCard etc.).""",Bitcoiner2017,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/19ebdab/ukraine_tax_question/,/r/ukraina/comments/19ebdab/ukraine_tax_question/,18,2024-01-24 07:13:50,16,,False,0.94,Економіка,2024-02-09 21:08:13.489609

I have been living in Ukraine for a few years, with a residence permit - spouse is Ukrainian. Now we want to get ourselves an apartment. I have some savings in my bank account abroad, which I had before moving to Ukraine - not any recent income.

My question is, if I transfer this money to my Ukrainian bank account, will Ukrainian tax authorities consider this foreign income and would I have to pay 18% tax on it? That would be a bummer.

Sorry if my question sounds stupid :) But I couldn't find much other than a few quotes in the Privat Bank website which mention foreign transfers as taxable income, but on a wiki pageI found quotes stating that transfers between spouses, even from abroad, are not considered taxable income.

The rocket-propelled infantry flamethrower Shmel projectile, having a caliber of only 93 mm, is not inferior in power to 152 mm artillery shells. In the right hands, this weapon can change the outcome of a battle. This is well known to the military personnel of the motorized rifle units of the Vostok group of forces, who are mastering the destruction of enemy equipment with the help of Shmel at one of the training grounds on the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic. During training, military personnel hit targets simulating enemy military equipment at a distance of more than 500 meters.

The ammunition covers this distance in less than three seconds. In a real battle, a flamethrower needs to get as close as possible to his target and hit it in a matter of seconds. The Shmel is a disposable weapon and after firing the fighter must immediately leave the line of fire under the cover of shooters. According to fighters, this weapon is easy to use and effective in combat. Shmel have proven themselves well when fighting enemy armored vehicles, including Western-made ones.

UkraineRussiaReport,1amz1it,"UA POV - Ukraine’s Outgunned Military Has a Calculating, Hard-Charging New Chief Oleksandr Syrskiy commands ground forces low on equipment and manpower as Russia ramps up its assaults - THE WALL STREET JOURNAL","# [Ukraine’s Outgunned Military Has a Calculating, Hard-Charging New Chief](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraines-outgunned-military-has-a-calculating-hard-charging-new-chief-cfe37bba?mod=europe_news_article_pos1)

# Oleksandr Syrskiy commands ground forces low on equipment and manpower as Russia ramps up its assaults

It was a dark and foggy night in the eastern Ukraine city of Bakhmut in December 2022, and Russian forces were pressing through a gap in the Ukrainian line.

Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskiy, commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, rushed to the nearest command post and ordered troops to plug the hole. By morning, they had repelled the Russian thrust.

Col. Gen. Mykhailo Koval, who was with Syrskiy that night, summed up the commander’s approach: “If you allow people to relax and start giving up their positions, then you’ll get a landslide.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky promoted Syrskiy to commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces on Thursday, as Russia’s invasion approaches a third year and Ukraine faces a battlefront much like that night in Bakhmut.

[Outgunned and outnumbered](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraine-rations-munitions-as-end-of-u-s-aid-looms-russia-inches-forward-42b9462c), Ukrainian troops are on the defensive after a failed counteroffensive last year. Russia doesn’t appear to have the immediate capacity to break through Ukraine’s defensive lines, but is inching forward in a handful of places with infantry attacks against Ukrainian front-line units low on manpower and equipment.

Much is out of Syrskiy’s hands. Ukraine’s military is heavily dependent on Western supplies of weapons and ammunition, especially from the U.S., where a fresh support package is stuck in Congress.

Officers who have worked closely with him said Syrskiy is accustomed to fighting at a disadvantage after two years of war against a larger opponent.

“He is a classic military crisis manager,” said Col. Serhiy Cherevatiy, a spokesman for Ukraine’s armed forces who has worked closely with Syrskiy during the war. “He’s always in favor of staying active, if it’s not possible to attack then it’s active defense with elements of counterattack to damage the enemy as much as possible.”

Syrskiy’s promotion to the top job follows [the dismissal of the popular Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhniy](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/ukraine-ousts-top-general-in-reboot-of-war-effort-27b93cde), who had disagreed with Zelensky over the status of the war and questions around mobilization.

In a video address announcing Syrskiy’s appointment on Thursday, Zelensky said “urgent changes” were needed to [overhaul the military](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelensky-facing-rising-challenges-touts-leadership-overhaul-db96ab08?mod=europe_news_article_pos3) and address what he said was a growing divide between front-line soldiers and generals in headquarters.

In a statement Friday, Syrskiy said he would focus on logistics, improving military administration and finding a balance between fighting and training. He also echoed earlier comments by Zaluzhniy that Ukraine needed “new technical solutions,” including unmanned and radio-electronic warfare systems to retake more territory.

Retired Col. Viktor Kevliuk, who worked under Syrskiy from 2019 to 2020, said he’s a strong manager who listens to advice from key subordinates before making a decision.

“He’s able to form a team and put people in key positions who are able to generate ideas,” said Kevliuk. “He knows operations are not planned in one head.”

An ascetic who sleeps little, Syrskiy is known for his passion for exercise, on the cross-trainer or in the weights room, to clear his mind.

He taught himself English and is a keen student of [modern military innovations](https://www.wsj.com/world/low-on-ammo-ukraine-tries-to-build-a-million-explosive-drones-57f8fb52?mod=europe_news_article_pos5), including drones, as well as military history. He is known to cite Epaminondas, a Greek general in the fourth century B.C. known for concentrating overwhelming force at one point on the battlefield to overcome a stronger enemy.

Syrskiy, 58, was born in Russia and attended a top Moscow military school before he was assigned to Ukraine. The Soviet Union collapsed and he remained in Ukraine, rising up the officer ranks.

In 2019, he was appointed commander of Ukrainian ground forces and, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, he took command of the defense of Kyiv. There, he became known as an organizer prepared to take front-line command and consider unconventional methods.

In the early days of a war, a businessman came to Syrskiy with the idea of blowing up a dam to flood the Irpin River on Kyiv’s western flank. The general quickly agreed, and the subsequent rise in water levels helped hold the Russians back.

When the Russian army brought up pontoon bridges and crossed into the village of Moshchun, he spent several days commanding near the front lines and the Russians were pushed back. Syrskiy was made a Hero of Ukraine for the victory in Kyiv, the highest state honor.

In fall 2022, Syrskiy commanded a successful counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region, where a lightning operation took back more than 1,000 square miles of territory in a few days. Fellow officers say he planned an operation that took the Russian army by surprise, destroying their communications and leaving them retreating in disarray, leaving behind much of their equipment.

“It was a precise calculation,” said Koval, the general. “He found the enemy’s weak points.”

Syrskiy was then put in charge of the defense of [Bakhmut](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-battles-to-hold-off-russia-in-bakhmuts-western-districts-2c54b03f), an eastern city that was under withering Russian attack for months. Ukraine decided to hold the city to wear down Russian troops and prevent a breakthrough that could have allowed Russia to seize more territory. But the cost was high in Ukrainian lives, too, earning Syrskiy some criticism among ordinary soldiers.

“It was a meat grinder,” said one Ukrainian corporal who served in Bakhmut.

Syrskiy doesn’t have the same level of trust in the ranks as his predecessor, the corporal said, but soldiers remain focused on their jobs. “Personnel changes don’t alter our task: to fight and win this war,” he said. “We have seen clearly what will happen to us and our cities if we don’t.”

Cherevatiy, the armed forces spokesman, said that such criticism sprang from having to fight a war against an enemy with more weapons, people and equipment. “It requires constant tough decisions,” he said. “He is tough, not cruel.”

UkraineRussiaReport,1amhjik,UA POV - Ukraine is in a bind over mass conscription - THE SPECTATOR,"# [Ukraine is in a bind over mass conscription](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/ukraine-is-in-a-bind-over-mass-conscription/)

In the second world war, the average age of a combat soldier was 26. In the Falklands, it was 23. For Ukrainian soldiers, it’s 43. The war in Ukraine has been, so far, fought mostly by fathers so their sons and daughters can rebuild the country when the fighting ends. But resisting Russia has cost so much and has continued for so long that the Ukrainian army is depleted. What to do next is a question that’s not just dividing the country but its two foremost leaders: President Volodymyr Zelensky and Valery Zaluzhny, the head of the military.

Ukraine’s 600-mile front line is being defended by 880,000 soldiers, according to Zelensky. Most of them have had no rest from fighting since the start of the full-scale war two years ago. Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s iron general, who played a key role in repelling Russian attacks and reclaiming around half of the territory initially seized, wants to recruit up to half a million more men. Building up reserves will allow the military to replace those exhausted by fighting, injured and dead. Russia plans to conscript 400,000 more soldiers; Ukraine needs to respond to this challenge. Zelensky, however, has not only refused Zaluzhny’s proposal but intends to remove the general from his post, saying a ‘reboot’ of the Ukrainian government and military command is required.

Zelensky’s objection is partly on the basis that 500,000 new conscripts would come with a hefty price: at least £10 billion for training, pay, clothing, food and equipment. That’s about a quarter of Ukraine’s government spending for this year and almost half the military budget. Western aid cannot be used to pay soldiers, and given Ukraine’s deficit, Zelensky has said the recruitment drive is unaffordable. ‘It takes six civilians paying taxes to provide for one soldier,’ he said recently, urging the six million Ukrainian refugees living abroad to return home and pay taxes to provide for those already fighting.

While Zelensky’s logic makes sense at a time of wavering western support, delaying mass conscription puts an even heavier strain on the existing forces. Last week, Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast entered the city of Avdiivka, which they have been trying to capture for a decade. They are now only a few hundred feet away from the main supply route of the Ukrainian defenders. The Russian breakthrough can only be prevented if Ukraine deploys infantry reserves with experience in fighting in urban areas.

The fate of Kupyansk, a city in the Kharkiv region, also hangs in the balance. Russia is said to have assembled 40,000 troops, 500 tanks and more than 600 fighting vehicles for an assault. Just 20,000 Ukrainian troops will defend the city. The case for re-inforcements is clear, given Moscow’s ambitions to seize the entire Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and a part of Kharkiv Oblast up to the Oskil river, all in time for Putin’s re-election next month.

While Zelensky may not accede to Zaluzhny’s demand for 500,000, he does agree that boosting conscription is inevitable. ‘You either work or you fight,’ he said in his New Year speech. More Ukrainians will be called up, but how many, and from which demographic, is a subject of intense debate. Zelensky has shied away from discussing it.

Some opposition party figures have resorted to populist tactics, advocating for the conscription of ‘MPs and oligarchs’ children first’. Some refused to vote, saying the new regulations were too repressive. Others have proposed a more generous enlistment policy: doubling salaries for conscripts, for example, or giving them free flats when they are discharged. It’s a fantasy, of course: the money doesn’t exist.

A 72-page draft conscription law was meant to have been passed last month, but the parliament was afraid to vote it through because of a public backlash. Last week, MPs were handed a new version of the bill with minimal changes, and there appears to be no option to avoid voting for it this month.

Under the new law, the minimum conscription age will be lowered to 25, from 27. Summonses will be sent online and distributed in person. All new recruits will be trained for two to three months, while those aged 18 to 24 will be obliged to undergo five months of military training. The minimum salary is set at 20,000 hryvnias per month (£420), a figure that can go up to 120,000 hryvnias (£2,500) depending on where soldiers are posted and at what level.

The topic of mass mobilisation has led to a rapid decline in public confidence across all government institutions – the parliament, the President’s office, and the defence ministry. No one wants to be the proponent of conscription and so a blame game has started in Kyiv. MPs from Zelensky’s Servant of the People party have been instructed to direct questions to the military: let the generals face the backlash. The President had been expected to host the press conference announcing the new mobilisation rules and to field the difficult questions. In his place was Zaluzhny, holding his first-ever press conference.

Zaluzhny, whose approval rating is far higher than Zelensky’s, said it was not his job to decide who was drafted. ‘We are an army,’ he said. ‘Our focus should be on fighting, not interfering in the lives of civilians.’ The politicians behind the policy were nowhere to be seen. The public sees the news from the front and knows that the choice is between conscription or Russian occupation, but that doesn’t make it easier. The gap in Ukraine between those who are fighting and those who aren’t is wider than ever. The soldiers can’t understand why it should be only their war, and why the reinforcements that are desperately needed aren’t arriving in greater numbers. Civilians were hoping the war could be fought without them, which partly explains their adulation of the soldiers.

‘I have been on the front line for a year and already feel extremely exhausted,’ says Fedir Rudyy, a soldier in the 72nd brigade that is defending Vuhledar in Donetsk region. ‘It’s even more difficult for my brothers who have been here for two years… this reduces both fighting ability and morale. When there is no one to replace you, it becomes almost impossible to go on leave.’

Joining the army was seen as a one-way ticket: those in uniform would stay until they were injured or dead. Fearing the draft, at least 25,000 fighting-age men have fled Ukraine. More than 18,000 have been caught trying to cross the border. It’s a vicious circle: the tougher it gets on the front line, the more civilians want to avoid it, so the worse the manpower shortages become.

The new enlistment rules promise that soldiers who serve 36 months can go home and be immune from enlistment for two years. However, Zaluzhny has said this would be possible only if Ukraine prepared a sufficient number of trained reserves and there were no escalation on the battlefield. Enlisting soldiers would also be easier if people could see that the injured were well looked after, but this is not the case. One poll showed three-quarters of soldiers worry about being abandoned by the state if they were injured or once the war is over. They fear they will be unable to find a job in the future. ‘To mobilise more people, you need to show that those who have done their duty live a post-army life with a clear conscience, benefits, opportunities, social security and respect,’ says Sergeant Borys Khmilevskyi, an instructor in tactical medicine.

Those who dodge the draft can expect harsh penalties, such as losing the right to travel outside Ukraine or drive a vehicle, the confiscation of assets and even imprisonment. Some military men are talking about the need for further ‘tough mobilisation’ tactics. Anatolii Stuzhenko, commander of the 118th brigade, went so far as to suggest that those who avoid service should be ‘shot in the knee’ and need to know they will rounded up by Russians if the war is lost. ‘If we fall, all these couch potatoes will be swept into a pile.’ His words reflect the desperation soldiers feel while Ukrainian politicians fret about the unpopular draft law.

In what will probably be his last essay as the army chief, Zaluzhny wrote that it was time to accept that western sanctions against Russia have failed. Moscow’s ability to ‘mobilise human resources’, he said, contrasts with ‘the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces without the use of unpopular measures’. Ukraine’s only means of gaining an advantage over Russia is to change the rules of the war by using technology and DIY drones, to ‘master the entire arsenal of relatively cheap, modern and extremely effective assets that are rapidly developing’. He thinks this must be a homegrown industry, mindful that allies’ resolve may weaken and supplies may dry up.

Zelensky may not have appreciated being given this advice in public, but it was a salutary reminder for him. As commander-in-chief, he will bear the responsibility for how this war ends. While General Zaluzhny will be regarded as a national hero for the rest of his life, the President’s legacy will be determined by what is left of Ukraine.

UkraineWarFootage,17l9am3,Biden may veto GOP's Israel aid package without funding for Ukraine,"  
U.S. President Joe Biden would likely [veto](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/veto/) a bill put forward by House Republicans to provide aid to Israel without including funding for Ukraine and other priorities.  
""I think we've been very clear... how deeply concerning this House Republican bill is and how it doesn't meet our national security means and meet needs,"" National Security Council spokesperson John [Kirby](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/kirby/) said at a press briefing.  
The White House's $106 billion funding bill, which includes $14.3 billion for Israel and $61.4 billion for Ukraine, among other items, has been held up for weeks by infighting in the Republican-led House of Representatives.

UkraineWarRoom,1akbqz5,"It became known how much money Russia allocated for buying ""Shahed-136"" from Iran. The number is simply shocking. The #kremlin spent almost three hundred thousand dollars for a set of spare parts bought on #Ali Express.","The hacker group prana Network has announced that they have successfully hacked the email servers of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps front company called Sahara Thunder. Here's what it found.

Iran named the starting price of 23 million rubles for one ""Shahed"" ($375,000). However, during the negotiations, an agreement was reached at the level of 12 million rubles per board when ordering 6,000 units ($193,000) and 18 million rubles ($290,000) when ordering 2,000 units.  
290 thousand dollars for a winged ""Shahed-136"", the maximum cost of which does not exceed 30 thousand dollars.

There is only one explanation. Not only Russian corrupt officials, but also Iranian ones benefit from this purchase.

In its decision to add him to the list in March 2022, soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, the EU described Usmanov as having ""particularly close ties"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  
""He actively supported the Russian government's policies of destabilisation of Ukraine,"" the EU sanctions decision says.  
The European Court of Justice also rejected a similar appeal against the sanctions list by Russian former first deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov.  
The EU has described him as ""supporting actions and policies that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine"".

As the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer, India responded to the decrease in Russian oil imports by increasing its imports of Iraqi oil. [LSEG](https://www.facebook.com/LSEGInSriLanka?__cft__[0]=AZVyL6-O9Xitf5xiv-F8tj1-5ASaKqbkJrcddUMZAc5cczHJUIc4Ru_IoWpLNaBYMnO-am4tx64afgxxhaBW2jxXrQNE3sVBKV90jgNfHG3WvxzbGHSXzpm0-iqQmAqbfNii6Ek9J0hRp3AVUfTm6tYz&__tn__=-]K-R) data revealed a 4.2% reduction in imports from Russia to 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd), while [Vortexas](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090093590850&__cft__[0]=AZVyL6-O9Xitf5xiv-F8tj1-5ASaKqbkJrcddUMZAc5cczHJUIc4Ru_IoWpLNaBYMnO-am4tx64afgxxhaBW2jxXrQNE3sVBKV90jgNfHG3WvxzbGHSXzpm0-iqQmAqbfNii6Ek9J0hRp3AVUfTm6tYz&__tn__=-]K-R) ship tracking data indicated a 9% slide to 1.2 million bpd.

Serena Huang, Vortexa's Head of APAC Analysis, pointed out that factors such as the narrowing discounts on Russian crude compared to Middle Eastern crude, recent U.S. sanctions on shipowners transporting Russian crude above the set price cap, and rising tanker premiums due to Red Sea attacks had made Russian crude less appealing to Indian refiners in recent months. She further suggested that India's imports of Russian crude might continue decreasing in the upcoming months.

&#x200B;

In the previous year, India emerged as a significant buyer of discounted sea-borne Russian oil after Western nations had suspended imports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, in December, the [US](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/us?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVyL6-O9Xitf5xiv-F8tj1-5ASaKqbkJrcddUMZAc5cczHJUIc4Ru_IoWpLNaBYMnO-am4tx64afgxxhaBW2jxXrQNE3sVBKV90jgNfHG3WvxzbGHSXzpm0-iqQmAqbfNii6Ek9J0hRp3AVUfTm6tYz&__tn__=*NK-R) imposed sanctions on ships and vessel operators carrying Russian oil sold above a $60-per barrel cap established by the [G7](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/g7?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVyL6-O9Xitf5xiv-F8tj1-5ASaKqbkJrcddUMZAc5cczHJUIc4Ru_IoWpLNaBYMnO-am4tx64afgxxhaBW2jxXrQNE3sVBKV90jgNfHG3WvxzbGHSXzpm0-iqQmAqbfNii6Ek9J0hRp3AVUfTm6tYz&__tn__=*NK-R). Banks and service providers were instructed to ensure that cargoes adhered to the price limit.

Following the imposition of sanctions, there have been instances of several tankers intended to deliver Sokol crude to India being redirected. The evolving circumstances in the global oil market, driven by geopolitical events and sanctions, have contributed to a shift in India's oil import dynamics. This case indicates that the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries are effective, so the [EU](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/eu?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVyL6-O9Xitf5xiv-F8tj1-5ASaKqbkJrcddUMZAc5cczHJUIc4Ru_IoWpLNaBYMnO-am4tx64afgxxhaBW2jxXrQNE3sVBKV90jgNfHG3WvxzbGHSXzpm0-iqQmAqbfNii6Ek9J0hRp3AVUfTm6tYz&__tn__=*NK-R) and [US](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/us?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVyL6-O9Xitf5xiv-F8tj1-5ASaKqbkJrcddUMZAc5cczHJUIc4Ru_IoWpLNaBYMnO-am4tx64afgxxhaBW2jxXrQNE3sVBKV90jgNfHG3WvxzbGHSXzpm0-iqQmAqbfNii6Ek9J0hRp3AVUfTm6tYz&__tn__=*NK-R) should continue searching for and finding any loophole used by Russia to circumvent sanctions.

Elisey was shot dead by the russian army as he and his mother and three-year-old brother tried to escape from the occupied village of Peremoha in the Baryshivskyogo district. First, they walked and then drove in a column of five cars. The russians saw that they were peaceful people: women and children. They were released at first.  


And then russians shot the column. Seven people died. Among them was Elisey. He was found dead lying in the back seat.  


Mother Inna buried her son twice. First in the garden, near the house in Peremoha village, where they were hiding from missiles and shells. She buried him without a priest, without a coffin. Elisey's father fought at the frontline back that day. russians did not even allow the boy's body to be taken to the cemetery.  


Elisey was reburied in the new cemetery in Brovary. In a closed coffin. His father never saw the body. Inna wanted him to remember his child alive. The father of Elisey was allowed to come for the funeral from the frontline. He will soon return to war.

UkraineWarReports,u6n57v,Will the war in Ukraine lead to a surge in anti-Kremlin ethnic Russian ultranationalism?,"To many Western observers, Russia appears to be a Russian ultranationalist state, but this isn't entirely true.  Russia is a Eurasian state comprised not only of ethnic Russians but hundreds of other ethnic groups as well.  While Russian nationalism is a tool of Kremlin doctrine, Putin has to walk a tight rope between trying to keep ethnic Russians happy, while also keeping Russia's minorities happy as well.  In order to do this, Russia has to rely on a ""carrot and stick approach"".  On the one hand, heavy repression, and on the other hand, rapid investment in order to improve living conditions when necessary to keep people happy.  The prime example of this is Chechnya.  The region was pretty much flattened by the Russian army 20 years ago but was rapidly rebuilt right after.  Anti-Russian elements were quickly executed, and then rapid investment followed to the point where the average Chechen actually enjoyed a higher standard of living than the average ethnic Russian.  The Chechens did not pay the bill for the conflict, which was largely given to already impoverished provincial Russians.

Right now, Eastern Ukraine is in the ""stick"" approach.    The region is getting destroyed.  However, afterward, I predict the same thing will happen as in Chechnya.  The people will be subject to an indoctrination process, and then the ""stick approach"" will rapidly switch to the ""carrot approach"". The region will be rapidly rebuilt, and will actually have a higher standard of living than they did previously, probably better than the Russian average.  However, the ethnic Russian provincial people, already impoverished, simply will not allow further embezzlement to fund the Russian government's ""imperial projects"".  In the early 2010s, a Russian nationalist slogan was ""Stop feeding the Caucasus"".  Ethnic Russian nationalists were trying to push the Russian government to stop sending money and resources to Chechnya and other parts of the Caucasus, and instead just grant them independence.  Indeed, Putin was accused by Russian ultranationalists of being a ""closet liberal"" who was trying to turn ethnic Russians into second-class citizens while putting the interests of Chechens and other minorities first.   

Temporarily, I can see the war being a boom to Russian nationalism.  However, I don't think it will last once the Russian people are faced with paying the bills for the conflict. Russians are already often angry when forced to pay subsidies to the Caucasus and other restive regions.  That will pale in comparison to how much it will cost to rebuild and keep satisfied the Eastern and Southern regions of Ukraine.",None,https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u6n57v/will_the_war_in_ukraine_lead_to_a_surge_in/,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u6n57v/will_the_war_in_ukraine_lead_to_a_surge_in/,21,2022-04-18 20:48:06,23,,False,0.83,None,2024-02-09 21:08:25.754647

volunteersForUkraine,1aev0t4,How can I help as a pre-med student/earth sciences graduate?,"I am 22 years old. 

Biomedical science is pre med, I finished with a focus on chemistry. Pretty much I have fulfilled my obligations to entire medical school.

I also finished my FF1  and basic medic training. 

Earth sciences, I learned about a 33/33/33 split of geology, meteorology and environmental science. I could be a park ranger, or marine biologist or weatherman since I had a strong focus and interest in meteorology.

I would feel most comfortable in weather/climate modeling and forecasting or in a laboratory. I could also do geolocating since I am a beast at geoguessr (I've memorized around 400 native flora/fauna sppecies of the world among other things such as mountains, every mountain has a story, etc)  I could help trauma surgery, but I'd need a crash course on surgical procedures. I am not squeamish. Orthopedic surgery is an interest of mine and trauma surgery is often times just that just at a very unfortunate time. 

I wouldn't mind being close to the front lines, I was in Syria 2016 and I have family from the ME and Balkans (uncle has one leg) . I have been shot and been around explosions from bombs, though very far away. 

I have the certificates of all of these. Housing, I would be fine with a tent and outhouse somewhere at the minimum. Or even the lab I work in, I am not an extravagant man. 

I also do have construction experience, mostly framing and concrete work but not how they build/built in Ukraine that is for sure. I would say if I am running a sledgehammer somewhere it is because there was a missile strike.

I do not have a wife or children, or criminal record. I do have some tattoos that are questionable to some, but I consider it performance art and they are all hidden by a lab coat/t shirt. The sun wheel contrasts heavily with the seal of Solomon. Pretty much I have every early neolithic civilizations favorite art work/writing script somewhere on my skin. I also claim the right to use some of these icons since my ancestors are the people who made them. Other than the early Manchurian/meso American neolithic script, but I have it anyways. 

It's like memento, but anthropology. Which is another interest of mine, but as of right now is not very useful for the situation.

volunteersForUkraine,1909vfl,"Firefighter/EMT, some military experience. What's the fine print?","I'm a firefighter/EMT now. I got out of the military not long ago, but I'm not going to claim I'd be much use with some brush up tactical training. For EMT, it's a basic level certification, not paramedic. I deal with a lot of traumas, psychs, arrests, etc but I'm not going to claim to have the scope of a paramedic at this time. I have a lot of experience dealing with civilian populations and disaster relief operations from other activities.

I speak enough Russian to get by and am continuing to improve that. Obviously there's always a need to improve. I have no medical ailments and am very fit at 27.

I am anticipating involvement for 6+ months or longer, ie no short term stints. I know the pay is shit and that there's a lot of chaos right now. It's not some easy heroic thing or something I consider lightly. Just feels right. Talk me out of me, I'd prefer some reality over ""yeah come on, let's go liberate a country!""

So my questions -

1. With the broad stroke of my skillset, would Ukraine find much use for me?
2. What follow-on training would be preferable prior to going, or what training exists when I get there?
3. What accomodations are made to go over? My mental bar is pretty low, with the expectations of rationing and very little in the way of beds, so if it's anything better than ""sleeping in a trench and starving"" it's probably better than I expected. 
4. What are nasty downsides of this that people don't really talk about?
5.

volunteersForUkraine,18v222l,Volunteering without any experience,"Hello. Not sure if this is the right place, but plan on posting it here as well as a few other places.

Basically, I can no longer stand staying here in safe, stable, warm and wonderful Sweden. I feel so lucky and grateful to have been born here, but also that three decades of a carefree life is already more than most people can expect.

So long story short, ever since the invasion I haven't been able to stop thinking about all Ukrainians, soldiers and otherwise, wanting nothing more than just to live a normal life, and feeling like I ought to be out there instead of young men, fathers and loved ones.

The thing that's been holding me back is the fear of being useless or even getting in the way and being a burden by say getting sick and putting stress on hospital, or having people doing useful work have to waste time  training me for whatever task.
I know no Ukrainian, have no relevant education or experience, have had mental issues in the past and don't even have a driver's license. Not a very impressive résumé, so guess all I have to contribute is a body and motivation.

I'm not necessarily talking about soldering, though I wouldn't rule anything out if the International Legion or someone needs people even without experience. I'm open for anything. Clearing mines, gathering in the harvest or cleaning away rubble from streets, it's all one to me. Can't be too menial or boring or dirty et cetera.

So basically I guess im wondering if its a stupid idea or if Ukraine can use an extra hand despite all the handicaps I mentioned. If there's any charity or the like accepting international volunteers, or what would happen if I just showed up and started asking around. I guess worst case I would end up making some hostel and grocery stores a bit extra money.

The only other way I can think of helping is just a random idea to walk from Sweden to Kyiv in a crowdfunding effort. Hiking is at least something I'm good at. It's 2000km, but I guess you're not allowed on the autobahn, so probably longer. Never really understood why people give money for someone biking for a month or the like, but it seems to be quite popular for cancer awareness campaigns and so on, so I guess it might work. I would hate to have my name or picture show up in papers or social media though, but who would give money to someone preferring to stay anonymous. Corporate sponsors? I guess any publicity would be useful given how Russia's deprivations have fallen on most people's radar.

And finally I thought I should add that this is not a suicide mission, nor some search for a romantic adventure or way to get through personal issues. I have no illusions about what a hellscape a battlefield is, even though I obviously can't imagine the reality of the horrors being inflicted daily. All I'm sure of is I will forever regret having stayed at home.

I assume you will probably tell me to start a donation, join a local charity and the like, but I need to do something concrete. I'm far from wealthy, and any further donations would just be a drop in the bucket compared to government support packages. All i have is enough savings to stay for a year or two.

I realise this post probably comes across as self-centred, and in a way I guess it is, but my only purpose is to help in any way I can.

Thanks for reading and for any suggestions, and know that you all deserve my fullest respect.

I'll keep this short:

I'm a relatively new EMT, and would like to volunteer in a humanitarian/NGO capacity over in Ukraine, preferably for a few months (or longer) if possible. 

I've got about 5 years experience in the military in a Combat Engineer/Combat LifeSaver role but no combat experience. I do however have some travel experience including some time I spent along the Syrian border as a civilian back in 2018/2019. This is all to say, I'm not exactly experienced but I'm not incapable by any means. 

I've reached out to Global Outreach Doctors and Global Response Medicine but I'm not sure what other organizations are currently taking people as they all seem to have closed shop except for a few specialties. I also don't know how long it'll take to get a deployment from them and I'd like to leave as soon as I can to kind of maximize this time I currently have. 

If it helps any I've also got quite a bit of experience as a photographer/videographer working out in the field usually living/working out of a backpack. I actually have a degree in that as well.

Positives...

I qualified as an expert marksman by USMC standards, scored 97 on ASVAB and 1450 on SAT, am fairly physically fit (no Olympian but I can run an 8 minute mile and can hike with 40 lbs of gear comfortably), EMT and ambulance driver, impervious to arctic conditions, semi-fluent in French, and I have some experience with weapon smithing (AR platform and pistols) and metallurgy.

Negatives...

volunteersForUkraine,18enauo,Looking to volunteer,"
Hi all,

Looking at volunteering in the next month or so and wanting some information on the best way to go about it. I discharged a few months ago with 6 years military experience, no combat experience. Have a few questions about the whole process.

Is the best way forward through the International Legion pathway? If you've served/serving in the legion, how has your experience been? Would you recommend it? 

Is there any gear you'd recommend bringing that the UA/Legion doesn't assign? Also, has anyone had issues bringing certain gear across borders? If so, which borders and what gear?

For those that have served in Ukraine, what consequences have you faced upon returning to your home country? And which country, if you don't mind stating.

Happy for DMs if need be.

Thanks in advance",SpitefulUnderwear,https://www.reddit.com/r/volunteersForUkraine/comments/18enauo/looking_to_volunteer/,/r/volunteersForUkraine/comments/18enauo/looking_to_volunteer/,14,2023-12-09 21:16:15,19,,False,0.83,None,2024-02-09 21:08:27.367382

volunteersForUkraine,18ar6zs,Ukraine doesn't have enough men?,"Hello everybody,

Almost 2 year passed since the war begun, today while I was reading the daily updates, the increasing number of interviews/testimonies from ukrainian soldiers on the frontline highlight a worring lack of personnel and trained personnel.

Now, we are talking about a country of 40 milion people fighting a country with 140 million people. I was never good at math, but I am worried. 

I'm following constant updates since the war began and even before, I was following closely Euromaidan and the donbass war. I always cared about Ukraine,  and  I thought  to enlist myself after the full scale invasion, but considering that I have no military experience and I'm honestly scared to go to a war zone, I decided to support in other ways. But it's simply not enough. The attention towards the war in EU is faiding slowly, I think one of the best ways to make the EU public more aware of what needs to be done, is to involve more EU citizens into the conflict. It's clear to me that all the veterens and experienced fighters are already in Ukraine, and even if I'm reading constantly people trying to dissuade inexperienced people to go, more EU recruits could help both in public awareness and pressure on EU politicians to help the Ukranian resistance.

Am I just delusional and wrong?

We want to add two volunteers to the project as soon as possible, and perhaps more soon, as Aqueducks continues to expand. This will be 15km from the front.","At Volunteers For Ukraine, we are always seeking ways in which to help Ukraine; by supporting those organizations whose goals are also to bring humanitarian relief to the people of Ukraine that need it. Our partner, Aqueducks, has been on the ground and helping deliver fresh drinking water to Ukrainians living in the worst affected areas. It's very noble work and there's a real sense of pride felt in knowing that you're really helping people's lives. It's such an up-lifting experience. I've worked on the ground with them multiple times and VFU has been champions of their cause. Their work has sometimes put them in dangerous areas for long periods of time, but these guys (and gals) know what they're doing. 

We are looking for two motivated & self-funded volunteers to join Aqueducks in their mission. Basic housing, travel and transportation within Ukraine will be covered. You will be responsible for traveling to and from Ukraine, and for your food and basic daily expenses while in Ukraine. Some basic fluency of Ukrainian and/or Russian is required. You need to know how to drive manual transmissions and familiarity with driving trucks is preferred but not required. Aqueducks is seeking volunteers willing to commit to at least 2 months of working with them. It's a real committment of time away from home, so you will need to have that availability set in stone. Providing people with fresh drinking water can't suddenly stop because someone doesn't want to work or is not able to stay for their committed time. If something comes up, we get it. We're all volunteers. But at least give us a heads up because it'll allows us to get some more volunteers out there so there's no real interruptions in water delivery.

The location is approximately 15km from the frontlines, and that means you'd be within artillery range. It's important that you understand that there is a moderate risk of getting injured or killed. There is a war going on. We will provide you with body armor and a helmet, though if you'd rather bring your own, that's perfect fine. Even a remote risk is still a risk when you're within range of Russian shelling -so it's better to be catious and prepared. You'd also be exposed to the climate of life near the front during times of war... -you may see, hear and know things that are disturbing. People's stories... and sometimes their ruined lives. That's how it is when you volunteer in such areas. Hearing the distant thunder of artillery... made more real by the occasional loud explosion from incoming fire... -it can be a bit nerve-wracking for some people. If you're not going to be comfortable with some level of moderate risk and discomfort then maybe this isn't for you.   Kind and caring people are what we're looking for. Patience and tolerance are musts, as you'll be working in areas where people are living in desperate circumstances and your help is truly needed. 

If interested, please send an email with the subject title: *Aqueducks Volunteer from Reddit.* Include in the email your name, location, your availability, any relevant skills, language skills, and a short few sentences or so explaining why you want to volunteer for this position. At that point, I'll then review the emails (or one of our volunteers will) and send a few candidates over at a time until Aqueducks and the volunteers come to an agreement on their terms and understanding.

volunteersForUkraine,17xrtr5,Help needed. What governmental body in Ukraine is responsible for dealing with non-military volunteers there?,"Hi, I am working on a project that seeks to build a central volunteer hub for the whole of Ukraine. We already have several developers and the project is at a fairly advanced stage.

But somewhat oddly, what we are lacking is any substantive Ukrainian contacts and/or networks to work with.

Our project is entirely volunteer led and is very international in flavour, but it is hard to see how we can make it work without any very meaningful Ukrainian extra-governmental resources, or backing, or backing from other large volunteering networks within Ukraine.

We need to network and establish some kind of connection with people already heavily involved in working in the voluntary sector in Ukraine. Otherwise there's a risk, as advanced as our project might be and as much effort as we have all already put in, of the entire thing just becoming vaporware. That is clearly not something we want!

Ideally, what we would like is to add some strong Ukrainian contingent to our efforts, so that it can eventually become a mostly Ukrainian project staffed and maintained mostly with indigenous Ukrainians with a proven history and background in this sector.

I think if anyone does wish to speak with us, you will be impressed how much progress we have made and how far we have come, over a relatively short time. (About 5 months.)

We were in the Kherson region when we passed through a small village where many artillery strikes on civilian homes occurred last Saturday. The house of an elderly family was completely destroyed by several bombings. The woman was not at home, but unfortunately, her husband was present and lost his life in the bombings. As seen in the video, the woman is in a state of complete panic. She lost everything that day due to Russian aggression

Curiously, destruction of artillery batteries is highly associated, but with a negative coefficient.  I explain the connections and speculate about why.

UkraineOSINT,18qd58s,"In Ukraine, 66 combat engagements were registered in the frontline over the last day. Ukrainian troops repelled dozens of Russian attacks near Avdiivka and destroyed two enemy fighter-bombers, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.","**Russian attacks**

In total, the enemy launched 2 missile and 61 air strikes, fired 45 times from multiple launch rocket systems at the positions of our troops and populated areas.

Unfortunately, Russian terrorist attacks have resulted in deaths and injuries among the civilian population. Private homes and other civilian infrastructure have been destroyed and damaged.

Yesterday, the Russian occupants once again attacked Ukraine using 31 Shahed-136/131 UAVs. The Ukrainian air defense forces destroyed 29 attack UAVs.

Air strikes were carried out in: Sinkivka, Petropavlivka, Kyslivka in Kharkiv region; Novoyehorivka, Serebryanske forestry in Luhansk region; Yampolivka, Torske, New York, Ocheretyno, Tonenke, Avdiivka, Maksymilianivka, Maryinka, Novomykhailivka, Vodiane, Zolota Niva, Staromayorske in Donetsk region.

About 100 settlements in Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Mykolaiv regions came under artillery fire.

**Situation at the frontlines**

The operational situation in the **Volyn and Polissya** directions remains without significant changes.

In the **Siversk and Slobozhanske** directions, the enemy maintains a military presence in the border areas, conducts active sabotage activities to prevent the deployment of our troops to threatened areas, and increases the density of minefields along the state border in the Belgorod region.

In the **Kupiansk** direction, Ukrainian defenders repelled 21 enemy attacks near Synkivka, Kharkiv region, and Stelmakhivka, Luhansk region, where the enemy unsuccessfully tried to break through the defense of our troops.

In the **Lyman** direction, the enemy did not conduct any offensive (assault) actions.

In the **Bakhmut** direction, our soldiers repelled 5 enemy attacks near the settlements of Bohdanivka, Klishchiivka, and Andriivka in the Donetsk region.

In the **Avdiivka** direction, Ukrainian defenders continue to hold back the enemy, who keeps trying to encircle Avdiivka. Our soldiers are steadfastly holding the line, inflicting significant losses on the occupiers. Ukrainian defense forces repelled 14 enemy attacks east of Novobakhmutivka, Stepove, and Avdiivka and 17 attacks near Pervomayske and Nevelske in the Donetsk region.

In the **Maryinka** direction, Ukrainian defense forces continue to hold back the enemy in the areas of Maryinka and Novomykhailivka in the Donetsk region, where our defenders repelled five attacks.

In the **Shakhtarsk** direction, Ukrainian defenders repelled an enemy attack southwest of Staromayorsk, Donetsk region.

In the **Zaporizhzhia** direction, the Defense Forces repelled 3 enemy attacks near Robotyno and south of Huliaipol in the Zaporizhzhia region.

In the **Kherson** direction, the Defense Forces continue to expand the bridgehead. Despite significant losses, the enemy continues to try to drive our units from their positions. Thus, over the past day, the enemy carried out 23 unsuccessful assault actions, received a decent rebuff, and retreated.

**Enemy losses**

UkraineOSINT,1822bx1,Zelenskyy: 2024 must become year Ukraine throws Russia out of its skies," Strengthening air defenses is the best strategic investment in the security of our country. And 2024 must become the year when Ukraine throws Russia out of its skies, [reports](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1727590341816017005) President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy listed five reasons why strengthening Ukrainian air defense is the best strategic investment in the security of the state.

""First and foremost, every system and missile provided to Ukraine saves lives,"" the President notes.

Secondly, according to him, more people will be able to return from abroad to each large city and region that will be completely covered by a reliable air shield. This will give a significant boost to Ukraine's economy, help us reduce the budget deficit, and, as a result, the need for international financial assistance.

""Third, the stronger our air defense, the greater Ukraine's success in the Black Sea, the more maritime exports, the better protection of freedom of navigation, and the greater stability. This will allow us to deliver hundreds of thousands of additional tons of food via a more secure maritime export corridor and counter the global food crisis,"" Zelenskyy explains.

Fourthly, as the head of state noted, each additional air defense system and missile saves resources that would otherwise be needed to restore destroyed facilities, critical infrastructure, power systems, power grids, etc.

Fifthly, depriving Russia of the opportunity to terrorize Ukraine with missiles and drones will force the aggressor to abandon this tactic, which will generally contribute to the approach of victory.

The President notes that Ukraine is a large country, so the need for air defense is significant.

Zelenskyy is confident that strengthening our air defense capabilities is the best strategic investment in security, thanks to which our partners will also save a significant amount of resources in the long run.

""Since 2022, Ukraine has liberated more than half of the land that Russia has occupied. In 2023, Ukraine expelled the Russian fleet from most of the Black Sea. 2024 must become the year when Ukraine throws Russia out of its skies,"" the head of state emphasizes.",Few_Routine_1172,https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineOSINT/comments/1822bx1/zelenskyy_2024_must_become_year_ukraine_throws/,/r/UkraineOSINT/comments/1822bx1/zelenskyy_2024_must_become_year_ukraine_throws/,0,2023-11-23 14:27:01,12,,False,1.0,None,2024-02-09 21:08:29.883465

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, nevertheless acknowledged that Ukraine's counter offensive on the Zaporizhzhia front has essentially culminated, although ""three brigades"" are believed to have made it across the Dnipro river near Kherson.

""Neither side is capable of mounting a decisive operation on land,"" one of the officials said, and it appeared that ""a prolonged conflict"" was likely to follow in which long term US and European military aid would be crucial.

A significant force, described as three brigades, had established a position across the Dnipro that the Russians have proved unable to dislodge, although it was unclear, they said, how much armour the Ukrainian military had been able to get across the river.

But despite the cross-river success, the officials said they expected that Ukraine would most likely only be able to make incremental ""village at a time"" progress, a similar pace to summer efforts south of Orikhiv and Velyka Novosilka.",Few_Routine_1172,https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineOSINT/comments/17xii09/russia_has_sustained_casualties_of_300000400000/,/r/UkraineOSINT/comments/17xii09/russia_has_sustained_casualties_of_300000400000/,3,2023-11-17 16:11:15,10,,False,0.81,None,2024-02-09 21:08:29.883465

Monsters too host their own Oscars.  
Whisper quiet snakes of brimstone  
And the demons are no longer.

Ready printed propaganda,  
Eager lifted pen of Seymour.  
There's no need to quote Miranda:  
They are proud of what they're here for.

Vampire dies in sun, without blood -  
Strange, it's always cold in their home.  
Devils pray and pray for red flood  
While the rivers crimson dark foam.

No one sent the invitation,  
Cut the ties decided brother.  
Manners are the weak's invention  
And a man's flesh is best supper.

For the victims looks the hero -  
From their lives he'll liberate them.  
Foreign language speaks the tree rows:  
Holy fire guards the harsh elm.

Blaze and wrath replies to bullets.  
People's land for fiends is hostile.  
To grey ashes cursed orc tourists  
Turns on flash and roaring gospel.

Graceful road smiles in cold anger:  
They are here and they will not be.  
Each small pebble hides a dagger.  
Rustle, hustle - stinks the debris.

If they fight - why does it matter?  
Bigger always smaller conquer.  
Sky mute blinked with fury azure  
And the demons were no longer.",Nightshade20XV12,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveForUkraine/comments/1algoyf/and_the_demons_are_no_longer_a_poem/,/r/LoveForUkraine/comments/1algoyf/and_the_demons_are_no_longer_a_poem/,0,2024-02-07 23:11:51,14,,False,0.95,None,2024-02-09 21:08:31.660674
